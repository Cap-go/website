data_policy_goal_of_capgo: "The goal of Capgo is to track overall trends in your website traffic, it is not to track individual visitors. We don’t use cookies, we don’t generate any persistent identifiers and we don’t collect or store any personal or identifiable data. All of the data is aggregated data only and it has no personal information."
