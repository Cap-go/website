## Error Handling

Common error scenarios and their responses:

```json

{
  "error": "Invalid API key",
  "status": "KO"
}

// Missing required field
{
  "error": "Name is required",
  "status": "KO"
}

```

## Best Practices

1. **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for organizations
2. **Roles**: Assign appropriate roles to team members
3. **Email**: Use a group email for management_email to avoid issues with personal email changes
4. **Logo**: Host logos on a reliable CDN and use HTTPS URLs
