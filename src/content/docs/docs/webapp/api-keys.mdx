## What can I do with the api keys?

An API key can be regenerated, or removed or a new one can be added. You can also set expiration dates and create encrypted keys for enhanced security.

## How to see all api keys?

You need to go to [API keys page](https://console.capgo.app/dashboard/apikeys/) and there you will see all your api keys.

## How to add a new api key?

To add a new API key click on the little plus button

and then select the permissions you want to give to the new API key. You can select:

 - Read - the API key will be able to read all the data
 - Upload - the API key will be able to upload new versions from the CLI and read
 - All - The API key will be able to do everything

## Encrypted API Keys

When creating a new API key, you can choose to create an **encrypted key**. Encrypted keys provide enhanced security:

- The key is hashed using SHA-256 before being stored in the database
- **The plain key is only shown once** when you create it - make sure to copy and save it immediately
- After creation, the key cannot be retrieved or viewed again
- If you lose an encrypted key, you must create a new one

This is the recommended approach for production environments as it ensures that even if the database is compromised, your actual API keys remain secure.

## API Key Expiration

You can set an **expiration date** for your API keys. This is a security best practice that limits the window of exposure if a key is compromised.

### Setting an expiration date

When creating or editing an API key, you can optionally set an expiration date. Once the expiration date passes:

- The API key will no longer work for authentication
- Any requests using the expired key will be rejected
- Expired keys are automatically cleaned up after 30 days

### Organization policies

Organizations can enforce expiration policies:

- **Require expiration**: All API keys must have an expiration date
- **Maximum expiration period**: Limit how far in the future an expiration date can be set (e.g., maximum 90 days)
- **Enforce secure API keys**: Require all new API keys to be created as encrypted/hashed keys

If your organization has these policies enabled, you will be required to set an appropriate expiration date when creating new keys.

For more information on configuring organization-wide API key policies, see [Organization Security](/docs/webapp/organization-security/).
