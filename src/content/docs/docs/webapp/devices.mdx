## Show the list of all devices
First, let's take a look at the devices page. You can access it by [clicking on your app](/docs/webapp/main-page) and then [clicking on the devices tab](/docs/webapp/main-app-page).

## Show only developer devices
You might want to show only the overwritten devices (Devices that have a [custom channel](/docs/plugin/api/#setchannel) or a custom version)
To do that click on `Filters` and then on `Override`. It should look something like this:

## Configuring a device

To configure a specific device click on it in the table and then you should see something like this:

<figure><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" src="/device-specific.webp" alt="show one device" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

First the `Custom ID`. This is a very useful field that helps you connect the device to an ID you can recognize for your own users. 

Use it to easily identify which device belongs to which user. 

You can set it from the WebUI or from the device with `CapacitorUpdater.setCustomId({ customId: user });`

Next the force version. If this is set then this device will **ALWAYS** receive this version. It takes precedence over the channel.

Lastly the custom channel. If this is set then this device will not care about the public (default) channel and just use this one.
