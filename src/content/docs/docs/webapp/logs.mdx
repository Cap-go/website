## Understanding Application Logs

The Logs page provides a detailed history of update events and diagnostic information for your application. This is crucial for monitoring the update process, troubleshooting issues, and understanding how your devices interact with Capgo. You can access it by [clicking on your app](/docs/webapp/main-page) and then [clicking on the "Logs" tab (previously named "updates" in some older screenshots or documentation)](/docs/webapp/main-app-page).

From there you should see a page similar to this, displaying a list of log entries:

<figure><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" src="/logs.webp" alt="show logs" /><figcaption>Logs Page Overview</figcaption></figure>

Each log entry typically includes information such as the timestamp, the device ID, the log message or code, and the bundle version involved.

## Example Log Scenarios

To help you understand what the logs tell you, here are example sequences showing real device update journeys:

### Successful Update Flow

This is what a healthy update looks like in your logs:

| Time | Device ID | Action | Version | What it means |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|---------------|
| 10:00:01 | `a1b2c3d4` | `get` | 1.2.0 | Device checked for updates and received version 1.2.0 info |
| 10:00:02 | `a1b2c3d4` | `download_10` | 1.2.0 | Download started, 10% complete |
| 10:00:03 | `a1b2c3d4` | `download_50` | 1.2.0 | Download at 50% |
| 10:00:05 | `a1b2c3d4` | `download_complete` | 1.2.0 | Download finished successfully |
| 10:00:06 | `a1b2c3d4` | `set` | 1.2.0 | Bundle installed and activated |

### Device Already Up-to-Date

When a device checks but already has the latest version:

| Time | Device ID | Action | Version | What it means |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|---------------|
| 14:30:00 | `e5f6g7h8` | `noNew` | 1.2.0 | Device is already on the latest version, no update needed |

### Failed Update with Rollback

When an update fails and the device rolls back:

| Time | Device ID | Action | Version | What it means |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|---------------|
| 11:15:00 | `i9j0k1l2` | `get` | 1.3.0 | Device received update info |
| 11:15:02 | `i9j0k1l2` | `download_complete` | 1.3.0 | Download completed |
| 11:15:03 | `i9j0k1l2` | `set` | 1.3.0 | Bundle was set |
| 11:15:10 | `i9j0k1l2` | `update_fail` | 1.3.0 | App crashed or `notifyAppReady()` wasn't called - rollback triggered |
| 11:15:11 | `i9j0k1l2` | `reset` | builtin | Device reverted to the built-in version |

**Action needed**: Check that your app calls `notifyAppReady()` after successful initialization. See [the plugin documentation](/docs/plugin/api/#notifyappready) for details.

### Download Failure

When network issues prevent the download:

| Time | Device ID | Action | Version | What it means |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|---------------|
| 09:45:00 | `m3n4o5p6` | `get` | 1.2.0 | Device received update info |
| 09:45:01 | `m3n4o5p6` | `download_30` | 1.2.0 | Download started but... |
| 09:45:15 | `m3n4o5p6` | `download_fail` | 1.2.0 | Download failed (network timeout, connection lost, etc.) |

**Action needed**: The device will retry automatically on next app launch. No action required unless this happens frequently.

### Plan Limit Reached

When your account reaches its device limit:

| Time | Device ID | Action | Version | What it means |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|---------------|
| 16:00:00 | `q7r8s9t0` | `needPlanUpgrade` | - | This device won't receive updates until you upgrade or the billing cycle resets |

**Action needed**: [Upgrade your plan](/docs/webapp/settings/) or wait for the next billing cycle.

### Channel Configuration Blocking Updates

When channel settings prevent an update:

| Time | Device ID | Action | Version | What it means |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|---------------|
| 12:00:00 | `u1v2w3x4` | `disableAutoUpdateToMajor` | 2.0.0 | Device on v1.x can't auto-update to v2.x (major version jump blocked) |
| 12:05:00 | `y5z6a7b8` | `disableEmulator` | 1.2.0 | Emulator detected, and channel blocks emulators |
| 12:10:00 | `c9d0e1f2` | `disableDevBuild` | 1.2.0 | Dev build detected, and channel blocks dev builds |

**Action needed**: These are intentional protections. If you want to allow these updates, modify your [channel settings](/docs/webapp/channels/).

## Quick Reference: Common Log Codes

| Code | Category | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `get` | Success | Device received update information |
| `noNew` | Success | Already on latest version |
| `download_XX` | Progress | Download progress (10%, 20%... 90%) |
| `download_complete` | Success | Download finished |
| `set` | Success | Bundle activated on device |
| `update_fail` | Error | Update installed but app didn't confirm readiness (rollback occurred) |
| `download_fail` | Error | Download failed (network issue) |
| `checksum_fail` | Error | Downloaded file was corrupted |
| `reset` | Info | Device reverted to a previous version |
| `needPlanUpgrade` | Billing | Plan limit reached |
| `disableAutoUpdateToMajor` | Config | Major version updates blocked by channel |
| `disableAutoUpdateToMinor` | Config | Minor version updates blocked by channel |
| `disablePlatformIos` | Config | iOS disabled on this channel |
| `disablePlatformAndroid` | Config | Android disabled on this channel |
| `disableEmulator` | Config | Emulators blocked by channel |
| `disableDevBuild` | Config | Dev builds blocked by channel |
| `rateLimited` | Access | Too many requests from this device |

## Getting More Details About a Log

If you click on a specific log entry, it will typically take you to the [device's page](/docs/webapp/devices/). This allows you to see the full history for that particular device, which can be very helpful for diagnosing device-specific issues or understanding its update journey.
