## Understanding Application Logs

The Logs page provides a detailed history of update events and diagnostic information for your application. This is crucial for monitoring the update process, troubleshooting issues, and understanding how your devices interact with Capgo. You can access it by [clicking on your app](/docs/webapp/main-page) and then [clicking on the "Logs" tab (previously named "updates" in some older screenshots or documentation)](/docs/webapp/main-app-page).

From there you should see a page similar to this, displaying a list of log entries:

<figure><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" src="/logs.webp" alt="show logs" /><figcaption>Logs Page Overview</figcaption></figure>

Each row shows:
- **Timestamp** (UTC)
- **Device ID**
- **Action code** (what happened)
- **Version name** (bundle or `builtin`)

Click a row to jump to the device detail page for the full history.

### Sample log snippet (fake data)

| Time (UTC) | Device ID | Action | Version | What it tells you |
|------------|-----------|--------|---------|-------------------|
| 2025-01-14 10:00:01 | `A1B2C3` | `get` | 2.4.1 | Device asked Capgo if an update is available |
| 2025-01-14 10:00:03 | `A1B2C3` | `download_manifest_start` | 2.4.1 | Manifest fetch kicked off; SDK is about to download files |
| 2025-01-14 10:00:07 | `A1B2C3` | `download_40` | 2.4.1 | Bundle download is 40% complete |
| 2025-01-14 10:00:12 | `A1B2C3` | `download_zip_complete` | 2.4.1 | Zip finished downloading |
| 2025-01-14 10:00:13 | `A1B2C3` | `set` | 2.4.1 | Bundle installed and marked as next to run |
| 2025-01-14 10:05:00 | `B9C8D7` | `disableAutoUpdateToMajor` | 1.9.0 | Channel policy blocked a jump to 2.x |
| 2025-01-14 10:05:05 | `B9C8D7` | `rateLimited` | builtin | Device hit the request limit; SDK backs off until restart |

## Example Log Scenarios

To help you understand what the logs tell you, here are example sequences showing real device update journeys:

### Successful Update Flow

This is what a healthy update looks like in your logs:

| Time | Device ID | Action | Version | What it means |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|---------------|
| 10:00:01 | `a1b2c3d4` | `get` | 1.2.0 | Device checked for updates and received version 1.2.0 info |
| 10:00:02 | `a1b2c3d4` | `download_10` | 1.2.0 | Download started, 10% complete |
| 10:00:03 | `a1b2c3d4` | `download_50` | 1.2.0 | Download at 50% |
| 10:00:05 | `a1b2c3d4` | `download_complete` | 1.2.0 | Download finished successfully |
| 10:00:06 | `a1b2c3d4` | `set` | 1.2.0 | Bundle installed and activated |

### Device Already Up-to-Date

When a device checks but already has the latest version:

| Time | Device ID | Action | Version | What it means |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|---------------|
| 14:30:00 | `e5f6g7h8` | `noNew` | 1.2.0 | Device is already on the latest version, no update needed |

### Failed Update with Rollback

When an update fails and the device rolls back:

| Time | Device ID | Action | Version | What it means |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|---------------|
| 11:15:00 | `i9j0k1l2` | `get` | 1.3.0 | Device received update info |
| 11:15:02 | `i9j0k1l2` | `download_complete` | 1.3.0 | Download completed |
| 11:15:03 | `i9j0k1l2` | `set` | 1.3.0 | Bundle was set |
| 11:15:10 | `i9j0k1l2` | `update_fail` | 1.3.0 | App crashed or `notifyAppReady()` wasn't called - rollback triggered |
| 11:15:11 | `i9j0k1l2` | `reset` | builtin | Device reverted to the built-in version |

**Action needed**: Check that your app calls `notifyAppReady()` after successful initialization. See [the plugin documentation](/docs/plugin/api/#notifyappready) for details.

### Download Failure

When network issues prevent the download:

| Time | Device ID | Action | Version | What it means |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|---------------|
| 09:45:00 | `m3n4o5p6` | `get` | 1.2.0 | Device received update info |
| 09:45:01 | `m3n4o5p6` | `download_30` | 1.2.0 | Download started but... |
| 09:45:15 | `m3n4o5p6` | `download_fail` | 1.2.0 | Download failed (network timeout, connection lost, etc.) |

**Action needed**: The device will retry automatically on next app launch. No action required unless this happens frequently.

### Plan Limit Reached

When your account reaches its device limit:

| Time | Device ID | Action | Version | What it means |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|---------------|
| 16:00:00 | `q7r8s9t0` | `needPlanUpgrade` | - | This device won't receive updates until you upgrade or the billing cycle resets |

**Action needed**: [Upgrade your plan](/docs/webapp/settings/) or wait for the next billing cycle.

### Channel Configuration Blocking Updates

When channel settings prevent an update:

| Time | Device ID | Action | Version | What it means |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|---------------|
| 12:00:00 | `u1v2w3x4` | `disableAutoUpdateToMajor` | 2.0.0 | Device on v1.x can't auto-update to v2.x (major version jump blocked) |
| 12:05:00 | `y5z6a7b8` | `disableEmulator` | 1.2.0 | Emulator detected, and channel blocks emulators |
| 12:10:00 | `c9d0e1f2` | `disableDevBuild` | 1.2.0 | Dev build detected, and channel blocks dev builds |

**Action needed**: These are intentional protections. If you want to allow these updates, modify your [channel settings](/docs/webapp/channels/).

## Log codes (Capgo backend enum)

These codes come from the `stats_action` enum used by the dashboard API (`capgo/src/types/supabase.types.ts`). If you see a new code in the UI, it was emitted by the SDK or backend and validated against this list.

**Happy path & lifecycle**

| Code(s) | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `get` | Device asked Capgo for the current channel manifest |
| `download_manifest_start`, `download_manifest_complete` | Manifest download began / finished (for delta or multi-file bundles) |
| `download_zip_start`, `download_zip_complete` | Zip archive download began / finished |
| `download_10` … `download_90` | Download progress milestones |
| `download_complete` | Entire bundle downloaded |
| `set` | Bundle staged for next launch |
| `reset` | Device reverted to the builtin bundle |
| `delete` | Bundle removed from local storage |
| `uninstall` | App uninstall detected |
| `app_moved_to_foreground`, `app_moved_to_background` | App lifecycle events recorded by SDK |
| `ping` | Health/heartbeat check from device |
| `setChannel`, `getChannel` | Channel overridden or fetched via SDK call |

**Configuration or policy blocks**

| Code(s) | Why the update was blocked |
|---------|---------------------------|
| `disableAutoUpdate`, `disableAutoUpdateToMajor`, `disableAutoUpdateToMinor`, `disableAutoUpdateToPatch`, `disableAutoUpdateMetadata`, `disableAutoUpdateUnderNative` | Channel strategy forbids this semver jump |
| `disablePlatformIos`, `disablePlatformAndroid` | Platform is disabled on the channel |
| `disableDevBuild`, `disableEmulator` | Dev builds or emulators not allowed |
| `cannotUpdateViaPrivateChannel`, `NoChannelOrOverride`, `channelMisconfigured` | Channel selection or override failed |
| `missingBundle`, `cannotGetBundle` | Manifest refers to a bundle Capgo cannot serve |
| `needPlanUpgrade` | Org hit its plan/device limit |
| `rateLimited` | Too many requests; SDK throttles until restart |
| `blocked_by_server_url`, `backend_refusal`, `InvalidIp` | Server-side rule blocked the request |

**Download / integrity / install failures**

| Code(s) | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `download_fail` | Bundle download failed (network or response error) |
| `download_manifest_file_fail`, `download_manifest_checksum_fail`, `download_manifest_brotli_fail` | Manifest file couldn’t be retrieved or validated |
| `checksum_fail`, `checksum_required` | Integrity check failed or checksum missing |
| `unzip_fail`, `directory_path_fail`, `canonical_path_fail`, `windows_path_fail` | File system or unzip validation failed |
| `decrypt_fail` | Decryption failed (encrypted bundle) |
| `update_fail` | Bundle installed but app never called `notifyAppReady()`; rollback triggered |
| `download_zip_*` with no subsequent `set` | Download finished but install phase never completed |

## Getting More Details About a Log

If you click on a specific log entry, it will typically take you to the [device's page](/docs/webapp/devices/). This allows you to see the full history for that particular device, which can be very helpful for diagnosing device-specific issues or understanding its update journey.
