## Show all logs
First, let's take a look at the logs page. You can access it by [clicking on your app](/docs/webapp/main-page) and then [clicking on the updates tab](/docs/webapp/main-app-page).
From there you should see a page like this:

<figure><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" src="/logs.webp" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Getting more details about a log

If you click on a log it will take you to a [devices' page](/docs/webapp/devices/)
