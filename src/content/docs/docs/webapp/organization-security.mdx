Capgo provides comprehensive security controls that allow organization administrators to enforce security policies across all members. These features help you meet compliance requirements, protect sensitive data, and maintain a strong security posture.

## Overview

The Organization Security settings allow super admins to configure:

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Enforcement** - Require all members to enable 2FA
- **Password Policy** - Set password complexity requirements
- **API Key Security** - Enforce secure API keys and expiration policies

![Organization Security Settings](/org_security.webp)

The Security page is organized into clearly labeled sections:
1. **Security Tab** - Access all security settings from the Organization settings sidebar
2. **2FA Enforcement** - Toggle and status display for two-factor authentication requirements
3. **Password Policy** - Configure password complexity rules for organization members
4. **API Key Policy** - Settings for secure API keys and expiration requirements
5. **API Key Expiration** - Control whether API keys must have expiration dates

<Aside type="note">

Only users with **super_admin** role can configure organization security settings. Other members can view their compliance status but cannot modify the policies.

</Aside>

## Accessing Security Settings

<Steps>

1. Navigate to your organization settings by clicking on **Settings** in the sidebar
2. Click on the **Organization** tab at the top of the settings page
3. Select the **Security** tab from the organization navigation bar (highlighted with a shield icon)

</Steps>

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Enforcement

2FA enforcement requires all organization members to have two-factor authentication enabled on their accounts. This adds a critical layer of security by requiring both a password and a verification code.

### What Happens When 2FA is Enforced

- Members without 2FA are **immediately blocked** from accessing organization apps
- Both the web dashboard and CLI enforce this requirement
- New members must enable 2FA before they can access organization resources
- The system tracks which members have 2FA enabled in real-time

### Understanding the 2FA Status Panel

The Security page displays a comprehensive **Members 2FA Status** panel that shows:

- **Total Members** - The total number of members in your organization
- **2FA Enabled** (green indicator) - Members who have successfully enabled two-factor authentication
- **2FA Not Enabled** (orange warning indicator) - Members who still need to set up 2FA

When members don't have 2FA enabled, they appear in a **Members Without 2FA** warning box. This box shows:
- Each member's email address and their role in the organization
- A **Copy Email List** button to quickly copy all affected email addresses for communication

### Enabling 2FA Enforcement

<Steps>

1. Navigate to **Organization Settings > Security**
2. Locate the **Require 2FA for All Members** section at the top of the page
3. Review the **Members 2FA Status** panel to see which members will be affected
4. If there are members without 2FA, use the **Copy Email List** button to notify them before enabling
5. Toggle the switch next to **Require 2FA for All Members** to enable enforcement
6. The toggle will show **Disabled** or **Enabled** status on the right side

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">

Before enabling 2FA enforcement:
- Notify affected members in advance and share the [2FA setup guide](/docs/webapp/mfa/)
- Give them time to enable 2FA on their accounts
- Members without 2FA will lose access immediately when you enable enforcement
- Consider reaching out to members listed in the "Members Without 2FA" warning box

</Aside>

### CLI Support for 2FA Enforcement

You can also manage 2FA enforcement via the CLI:

```shell
# Enable 2FA enforcement
npx @capgo/cli organization set YOUR_ORG_ID --enforce-2fa

# Disable 2FA enforcement
npx @capgo/cli organization set YOUR_ORG_ID --no-enforce-2fa

# Check member 2FA status
npx @capgo/cli organization members YOUR_ORG_ID
```

For detailed information about 2FA enforcement, see the [2FA Enforcement guide](/docs/webapp/2fa-enforcement/).

## Password Policy

Password policies allow you to enforce password complexity requirements for all organization members. When a member's password doesn't meet the policy requirements, they must update their password before accessing organization resources.

The Password Policy section (marked with indicator **3** in the overview image) provides a simple toggle to enforce password requirements across your organization.

### How Password Policy Works

When you enable the password policy:
- All organization members must meet the password complexity requirements
- Users who don't meet the requirements will be locked out until they update their password
- The policy applies to all members regardless of their role

### Enabling Password Policy

<Steps>

1. Go to **Organization Settings > Security**
2. Scroll down to find the **Password Policy** section
3. Read the description: "Require organization members to use passwords that meet specific complexity requirements"
4. Toggle the **Enforce Password Policy** switch to enable it
5. The toggle description states: "When enabled, all organization members must meet the password requirements to access the organization"

</Steps>

### Available Password Requirements

| Setting | Description | Range |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Minimum Length** | Minimum number of characters required | 6-128 characters |
| **Require Uppercase** | Password must contain at least one uppercase letter (A-Z) | On/Off |
| **Require Number** | Password must contain at least one digit (0-9) | On/Off |
| **Require Special Character** | Password must contain at least one special character (!@#$%^&*, etc.) | On/Off |

### Member Compliance Tracking

When a password policy is active, you can monitor compliance:

- **Total Members**: Number of members in your organization
- **Compliant**: Members whose passwords meet the policy requirements
- **Non-Compliant**: Members who need to update their passwords

Non-compliant members are listed with their email addresses. You can copy the email list to notify them about the policy and required password changes.

<Aside type="tip">

When enabling a password policy for the first time, members with non-compliant passwords will be prompted to change their password on their next login. They won't be immediately locked out, but their access may be restricted until they comply.

</Aside>

### Best Practices for Password Policies

- **Start with reasonable requirements**: A minimum of 10-12 characters with mixed case and numbers provides good security without being overly restrictive
- **Communicate changes**: Notify your team before enabling new password requirements
- **Allow transition time**: Give members time to update their passwords
- **Consider password managers**: Recommend that team members use password managers to generate and store strong passwords

## API Key Security

Capgo provides two security controls for API keys: enforcing secure (hashed) API keys and requiring expiration dates. The API Key Policy section (marked with indicator **4** in the overview image) is identified by a key icon.

### Enforce Secure API Keys

The first option in the API Key Policy section is **Enforce Secure API Keys**. When enabled, this setting requires all API keys in your organization to be created using the secure/hashed format.

Hashed API keys are more secure because:

- The actual key value is never stored on our servers
- Only you (and your systems) have access to the full key
- Even if our database were compromised, your keys couldn't be used

The toggle description states: "When enabled, only secure (hashed) API keys can access this organization. Plain-text API keys will be rejected."

<Aside type="note">

Existing legacy (non-hashed) API keys will continue to work, but members won't be able to create new non-hashed keys when this policy is enabled.

</Aside>

### Enabling Secure API Keys

<Steps>

1. Go to **Organization Settings > Security**
2. Scroll down to find the **API Key Policy** section (look for the key icon)
3. Locate the **Enforce Secure API Keys** toggle
4. Toggle the switch to enable secure API key enforcement
5. Existing keys are not affected; the policy applies to new key creation

</Steps>

### API Key Expiration Policy

The second option (marked with indicator **5** in the overview image) is **Require API Key Expiration**. You can require all API keys to have an expiration date, limiting their validity period.

This is a security best practice that:

- Limits the window of exposure if a key is compromised
- Ensures regular key rotation
- Helps meet compliance requirements for credential management

The toggle description states: "When enabled, all API keys for this organization must have an expiration date"

### Configuring Expiration Policy

<Steps>

1. Go to **Organization Settings > Security**
2. Find the **API Key Policy** section
3. Locate the **Require API Key Expiration** toggle (below Enforce Secure API Keys)
4. Toggle the switch to enable the expiration requirement
5. Once enabled, set the **Maximum expiration days** (1-365 days)
   - This limits how far in the future expiration dates can be set
   - Example: Setting 90 days means keys can expire at most 90 days from creation

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">

When you enable the expiration requirement:
- New API keys must have an expiration date
- Existing keys without expiration continue to work
- Consider auditing existing keys and rotating those without expiration

</Aside>

### Recommended API Key Policies

| Use Case | Secure Keys | Expiration | Max Days |
|----------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **Development** | Recommended | Optional | 30-90 |
| **CI/CD Pipelines** | Required | Required | 90-180 |
| **Production** | Required | Required | 30-90 |
| **Enterprise/Compliance** | Required | Required | 30-60 |

## Compliance and Auditing

Organization security features help you meet various compliance requirements:

| Standard | Relevant Features |
|----------|-------------------|
| **SOC 2** | 2FA enforcement, password policies, API key controls |
| **ISO 27001** | All security features help demonstrate access control |
| **HIPAA** | Strong authentication and access management |
| **GDPR** | Data protection through access controls |
| **PCI DSS** | Multi-factor authentication, strong passwords |

### Monitoring Compliance Status

The Security dashboard provides real-time visibility into:
- How many members have 2FA enabled
- Password policy compliance across your organization
- API key security adoption

Use the "Copy email list" feature to easily export lists of non-compliant members for targeted communication.

## Troubleshooting

### "Access Denied: Security policy not met"

**Problem**: A member cannot access the organization.

**Solutions**:
1. Check if 2FA is enforced - member needs to [enable 2FA](/docs/webapp/mfa/)
2. Check if password policy is active - member needs to update their password
3. Verify the member's compliance status in the Security dashboard

### Cannot enable security features

**Problem**: Security toggles are disabled or not responding.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure you have **super_admin** role in the organization
- Check your network connection
- Try refreshing the page
- Contact support if the issue persists

### API key creation fails

**Problem**: Cannot create new API keys.

**Solutions**:
- If secure keys are enforced, ensure you're using the secure key creation flow
- If expiration is required, set an expiration date within the allowed range
- Check the maximum expiration days setting
