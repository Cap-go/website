## What is this about?

This page aims to answer some questions about the payment system in capgo.

## Plans

#### Q: How can I upgrade my capgo plan?
A: You can upgrade your capgo plan by going to [the settings](/docs/webapp/settings/#how-to-get-to-the-settings-page) and clicking on the **Plans** tab (1).

On this page you can:
- Toggle between **Monthly Plan** and **Yearly** billing (with a 20% discount for yearly)
- Choose from four plans: **Solo**, **Maker**, **Team**, or **Enterprise**
- Click **Subscribe** (2) on the plan that best fits your needs

Each plan shows:
- Monthly price and annual billing total
- Monthly active users included and overage pricing
- Storage and bandwidth allowances
- Build minutes/hours
- Features like dedicated support, custom domain, and SOC II compliance

If you don't want to commit to a plan, you can use **credits** instead - click "Learn about credits" to see how pay-as-you-go works.

After clicking Subscribe, a Stripe checkout page will open where you can enter your payment information securely.

## Credits

Credits provide a flexible alternative to upgrading your plan. They're useful when:

- **Temporary spikes** - You're temporarily going above your plan limits (e.g., a viral moment, seasonal traffic) and don't want to upgrade permanently
- **Plan mismatch** - The next plan tier doesn't fit your needs for other reasons (maybe you need more bandwidth but not more MAU)
- **Pay-as-you-go preference** - You prefer paying only for what you use beyond your base plan

#### Q: How do I access the Credits page?
A: Go to [the settings](/docs/webapp/settings/#how-to-get-to-the-settings-page) and click on the **Credits** tab (1).

The Credits page shows:

1. **Credits tab** - Navigate here from the Organization settings
2. **Credits Balance** - Shows your available credits (e.g., 0.00 / 0.00) and credits used in the current period
3. **Credits Used (USD)** - The estimated dollar value of credits consumed during the current billing period, plus available credits remaining
4. **Need more credits?** - Purchase additional credits instantly to keep your users receiving updates without disruption. Choose from preset amounts ($50, $100, $500, $5000) or enter a custom amount. The estimated total including taxes is shown before checkout
5. **Credit pricing** - Expand this section to see the pricing tiers for different usage types (MAU, storage, bandwidth)
6. **Credit transactions** - View your credit purchase and usage history

#### Q: How do I buy credits?
A: On the Credits page, select the amount you want to purchase (or use the dropdown for custom amounts), then click **Buy credits**. You'll be redirected to Stripe checkout where you can adjust the quantity and complete payment.

#### Q: When are credits used?
A: Credits are automatically consumed when you exceed your plan limits for monthly active users, storage, or bandwidth. They provide a flexible way to handle overages without service interruption

#### Q: Are payments secure?
A: Yes, payments are fully managed by stripe. Capgo never gets access to your credit card details. Stripe takes security very seriously. [Learn more about stripe security policy](https://stripe.com/docs/security/)

#### Q: Will capgo automatically upgrade my plan when I exceed the limit?
A: No, capgo will never change your plan.

#### Q: Will cagpo send me an email when my plan is near its limits?
A: Yes, capgo will send you an email informing you about the usage.

#### Q: Will the plan I purchase affect the organizations I am invited to?
A: No, the plan will only affect the organization you have currently selected. 
Please refeer to [the organization documentation](/docs/webapp/organization-system/#q-how-is-billing-done-within-orgs).

#### Q: What if I need a more tailored plan?
A: [Please contact capgo's support directly](/docs/getting-help#support-by-chat)

A:  A refund policy can be found [here](https://capgo.app/return/)
