## Managing channels

First, let's take a look at the channels page. You can access it by [clicking on your app](/docs/webapp/main-page) and then [clicking on the channels tab](/docs/webapp/main-app-page).

## Creating a channel

As you can see, there exists a plus button in the lower right corner. (`1` in the image) Clicking on it will open a modal where you can create a new channel.

Then after you click on `Add` a new channel should appear in the list.

## What does misconfigured mean?
Sometimes the configuration of a channel is not valid. In that case, you will get a big warning and the `Misconfigured` column will say `Yes` for one or more of the channels.
You can learn more about it [here](/docs/cli/commands/#disable-updates-strategy)

## Deleting a channel

Deleting a channel is straight forward. Just click on the trash icon and confirm the deletion. (`2` in the image)

## Managing a channel

Clicking on the channel name will open a modal where you can manage the channel. (`3` in the image)
This page should look something like this:

<figure><img src="/manage_channel_main.webp" alt="manage channel" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Let's go through the different sections.

First the `Bundle number` (`1` in the image). This is the current version for that channel. When asked to serve an update this channel will always attempt to respond with that version.* [^1]
Clicking on it should take you to the [bundle](/docs/webapp/bundles/) page.

Second the `Shared to` (`2` in the image) page. I recommend against ever using this. A new and better system is in the works.

Now the forced devices (`3` in the image). This is a list of devices that will always get updates from this channel. This is useful for testing purposes. You can add force a device to a channel from the [devices](/docs/webapp/devices/) page.

Lastly the settings (`4` in the image). This is where you can manage how the channels behave.
After you click on it you should see something like this:

The list of settings is long, but I will do my best to explain them all.

First the `Default channel` **THIS IS PROPABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE**.\
If a channel is marked as default, then it will be used as the default channel for all new devices.\
In different terms: If you have a new user capgo will try to serve him the latest version of this default channel.
Only 1 channel can be set to default at a time. If you try to break this rule you will be asked to confirm your action.

<figure><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" src="/confirm-make-default.webp" alt="confirm make change" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After you confirm the old default channel will be unmarked as default and the new one will be marked as default.

Second the `IOS` setting. This is relatively simple. If this is false then IOS devices will not be allowed to download updates from this channel.

Third is the `Android` setting. This is similar to `IOS`. If this is false then Android devices will not be allowed to download updates from this channel.

Fourth is the `Disable auto downgrade under native` setting. If this is true then it will be impossible to downgrade from a native version. This means that if you have uploaded a `1.2.0` version to the app store or play store and try to set the channel version to `1.1.0` then the update (downgrade) will fail.

Fifth is the `Disable auto update`. This setting is quite complex, and you can learn more about it [here](/docs/cli/commands/#disable-updates-strategy)

As for `Allow develoment build`. If this is true then development builds will be allowed to download updates from this channel. If not then any update request that has the `prod` set to false will be rejected. This is mostly useful for testing purposes.

Seventh is the `Allow Emulators`. If this is false then cagpo will disallow any update request that comes from an emulator. This is mostly useful for testing purposes.

Eight is the `Allow devices to self associate`. If this is true then the [setChannel](docs/plugin/api/#setchannel) method will be available. If this is set to false and you try to call the [setChannel](docs/plugin/api/#setchannel) method with this channel then the call will fail.
