## FAQ

### Can I create more than one organization?

No, not yet.

### How can I configure security policies for my organization?

Super admins can configure comprehensive security policies including:
- **2FA Enforcement** - Require all members to enable two-factor authentication
- **Password Policy** - Set password complexity requirements (length, uppercase, numbers, special characters)
- **API Key Security** - Enforce secure/hashed API keys and expiration policies

See the [Organization Security](/docs/webapp/organization-security/) documentation for detailed configuration instructions.
