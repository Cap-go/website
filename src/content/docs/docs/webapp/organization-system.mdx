## What is the organization system?

The organization system is a system in capgo that allows you to securely share your apps with members of your team.

### Q: How can I access my organization's info?

In order to access your organization's info, please go to [settings](/docs/webapp/settings/#how-to-get-to-the-settings-page) and then click on the `Organization settings`

### Q: How can I change the organization I am viewing?

To view the settings of a different organization, please click on the organization selector near your name.

If you cannot see this, then you are likely not on the settings page.

### Q: How can I see the members of my organization?
