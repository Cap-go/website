## Show all bundles

First, let's take a look at the bundles page. You can access it by [clicking on your app](/docs/webapp/main-page) and then [clicking on the bundles tab](/docs/webapp/main-app-page).

## Delete a bundle

They are 2 ways a bundle can be deleted:

 - Normally
 - Unsafely

The Unsafe way of deleting a bundle was added into Capgo on August 12, 2024.

The difference between the two ways is the ability to reuse the version number after the deletion.

For example, if you delete a version `1.0.0` the normal way and later try to upload a `1.0.0` version, it will fail.
If you delete this version via the unsafe delete, you will be able to upload a `1.0.0` version.

:::danger
Deleting a version unsafely and re-uploading it is REALLY dangerous.
It can cause all sorts of bugs and unpredicatble behaviour in the plugin.
It should NEVER be used for bundles that have been used in a public channel.
It is for this reason that deleting a version unsafely requires "super_admin" privileges

## Managing a specific bundle

Once you see the list of all bundles click on the one you want to manage. After you do that you should see something like this:

<figure><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" src="/bundle-info.webp" alt="bundle info" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Let's go through all of the elements on this page.

---

First you can see a `Channel`. This lets you know which channel this bundle is for. You can change the channel by clicking on it.
Once you click on it you should see something like this:

<figure><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" src="/bundle-change.webp" alt="bundle change" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

`Set bundle to channel` will allow you to link this bundle as the default for any channel.\
`Open channel` will open the channel page for the channel this bundle is for.\
`Unlink bundle from channel` will unlink this bundle from the channel it is for. 
(**WARNING**: If the bundle is linked to more than 1 channel then you will not be given an option on which channel to unlink)

Next, you can see the `Size`. If you click on it you will be able to download this bundle.
It should look something like this:

Lastly, there is the `Devices` section. You can all devices using this version there.
