## Managing a specific bundle

Once you see the list of all bundles click on the one you want to manage. After you do that you should see something like this:

<figure><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" src="/bundle-info.png" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Let's go through all of the elements on this page.

First you can see a `Channel`. This let's you know which channel this bundle is for. You can change the channel by clicking on it.
Once you click on it you should see something like this:

<figure><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" src="/bundle-change.png" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

`Set bundle to channel` will allow you to link this bundle as the default for any channel.\
`Open channel` will open the channel page for the channel this bundle is for.\
`Unlink bundle from channel` will unlink this bundle from the channel it is for. 
(**WARNING**: If the bundle is linked to more then 1 channel then you will not be given an option which channel to unlink)

Next you can see the `Size`. If you click on it you will be able to download this bundle.
It should look something like this:
