## What is this?

Cagpo has an extensive webapp to help you manage your projects. This webapp is built with Vue.js and is open source. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Cap-go/capgo/tree/main/src/) \
The webapp is avalible [here](https://web.capgo.app/). \
This webapp allows you to [manage channels](/docs/webapp/channels/), [manage versions](/docs/webapp/bundles/), [manage devices](/docs/webapp/devices/), [inspect logs](/docs/webapp/logs/), [manage billing](/docs/webapp/settings/) and [manage your account](/docs/webapp/settings/).

## How do I use it?

First, you need to create an account or log in. This is relatively simple and can be done by clicking the `Log in` button in the center of the screen. After you have logged in you will be redirected to the dashboard. This is the main page of the webapp. From here you can navigate to all the other pages.

## Creating an account

You have to click on the `Create a free account` in the bottom part of the login form. From then it will be as simple as filling a form and following the instructions.
