## What does the app page shows?

First, let's take a look at the main page of the app:

In Capgo, an app represents your mobile application integrated with Capgo's live update system. It allows you to manage updates, channels, and devices seamlessly.

Let's take a closer look at this. The main app page is divided into several key areas:

1.  **Top Navigation Bar:** Provides access to different sections of your app management:
    *   **Dashboard (1):** The current view, displaying key metrics and summaries.
    *   **Information (2):** Displays your app's core settings and details (see "App Information" section below).
    *   **[Bundles (3)](/docs/webapp/bundles/):** Manage your app's versions and releases.
    *   **[Channels (4)](/docs/webapp/channels/):** Configure and manage different update channels (e.g., production, beta).
    *   **[Devices (5)](/docs/webapp/devices/):** View and manage registered devices, including setting specific overrides.
    *   **[Logs (6)](/docs/webapp/logs/):** Access detailed logs and error reports for your app.
    *   **Builds (7):** View and manage your app builds.

2.  **Statistics Display:** Visualizes important metrics for the last billing period (data reflects usage from your billing day, not the 1st of the month):
    *   **Monthly Active Users (8):** Tracks the number of unique active users over time.
    *   **Storage (9):** Shows the current storage consumption.
    *   **Bandwidth (10):** Displays the bandwidth usage.
    *   **Active Bundle (11):** Shows the distribution of active devices across different app bundles.

3.  **Summary Cards:** Offers a quick overview of key counts:
    *   **Bundle Uploads (12):** Total number of app bundles uploaded.
    *   **Updates Statistics (13):** Total number of updates performed, including requests, installs, and failures.
    *   **Deployment Statistics (14):** Total number of deployments.

4.  **Display Options (15-18):** Controls for filtering and viewing the statistics:
    *   **Daily (15):** View statistics on a daily basis.
    *   **Cumulative (16):** View cumulative statistics over time.
    *   **Billing Period (17):** View statistics for the current billing period.
    *   **Date Range (18):** Select a custom date range (e.g., last 30 days).

## App Information

This section corresponds to the "Information" tab (1) in the top navigation bar. Here you can view and manage crucial details and settings for your application.

Here's a breakdown of the available fields and actions:

*   **App Icon (2):** Displays your application's icon. You can click the "Change" button to upload a new icon.
*   **App ID (3):** A unique identifier for your application within Capgo. This ID is not editable.
*   **App Name (4):** The display name for your application. You can modify this as needed.
*   **Default Upload Channel (5):** Specifies the default channel to which new bundles will be uploaded. You can click the edit icon to select a different default channel.
*   **Default Download Channel (6):** Specifies the default channel from which devices will download updates. You can click the edit icon to select a different default channel. See the [Default Channel Configuration](#default-channel-configuration) section below for detailed information.
*   **Auto Delete Bundles Not Used (after x seconds) (7):** This setting allows you to automatically delete old bundles that haven't been used for a specified duration (in seconds). Set to `0` to disable auto-deletion. This helps manage storage and keep your bundle list clean.
*   **Expose Bundle Metadata to Plugin (8):** When enabled, bundle link and comment fields will be sent to the Capacitor Updater plugin. This feature requires plugin version 7.35.0 or higher.
*   **Transfer App Ownership (9):** This section provides an option to initiate the transfer of your application to a different organization you are a part of.
*   **Delete App Button:** Permanently deletes your application from Capgo. This action is irreversible and will remove all associated data, bundles, channels, and devices.
*   **Update Button:** Saves any changes you've made to the editable fields on this page (e.g., App Name, Default Upload Channel, Auto Delete Bundles setting).

## Default Channel Configuration

The **Default Download Channel** is one of the most important settings for your app. It determines which channel new devices will receive updates from when they first connect to Capgo.

### How Default Channels Work

When a device requests an update from Capgo, the system determines which channel to use based on the following precedence (highest priority first):

1. **Forced device mapping**: If the device ID is explicitly forced to a channel in the channel settings, that channel always wins.
2. **Cloud override**: If the device has been assigned to a channel via `setChannel()` or manually in the dashboard, that override is used.
3. **Capacitor config `defaultChannel`**: If set in your `capacitor.config.*` file, this is used for test/beta builds.
4. **Default Download Channel**: The setting configured here—this is what ~99% of your production users will use.

### Platform-Specific Default Channels

You can configure **two separate default channels**—one for iOS and one for Android. This is useful when:

- You want to roll out updates to one platform before the other
- You need different update strategies per platform
- You're testing a new version on one platform while keeping the other stable

To set up platform-specific defaults:
1. Create two channels (e.g., `production-ios` and `production-android`)
2. In each channel's settings, enable only the relevant platform (iOS or Android toggle)
3. Mark both channels as "Default" - Capgo allows this when channels target different platforms

When a device requests an update:
- iOS devices will receive updates from the iOS-enabled default channel
- Android devices will receive updates from the Android-enabled default channel

### Single Default Channel (Recommended for Most Apps)

For most applications, a single default channel that supports both platforms is the simplest approach:
1. Create one channel (e.g., `production`)
2. Ensure both iOS and Android toggles are enabled
3. Mark it as the default channel

This ensures consistent behavior across all platforms and simplifies your release workflow.

### Changing the Default Channel

When you change the default channel:
- **New devices** will immediately start receiving updates from the new default
- **Existing devices** that already have a channel assignment (via override or force) will NOT automatically switch
- To move existing devices, you need to either:
  - Use `setChannel()` to override them programmatically
  - Force them to the new channel in the dashboard
  - Delete their device entries (they'll re-register with the new default)

> **Tip**: Always test your new default channel with a small group of forced devices before making it the default for all users.
