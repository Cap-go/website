## What does the main page shows?

First, let's take a look at the main page of the app:

Let's take a closer look at this.

First the stats. The stats are beginning reworked thus they cannot be documented at this time. We will add a stats section when they are fully operational.

Second, let's take a look at all the available menus and what they do.

The first button will take you to the [channels](/docs/webapp/channels/) page. You can create/delete/configure the app's channels there.\
The second button will take you to the [bundles](/docs/webapp/bundles/) page. You can see all of the app's versions there.
The second button will take you to the [device](/docs/webapp/devices/) page. You can see all of the devices there. You also can set device's specific overwrites from there.
The second button will take you to the [updates](/docs/webapp/logs/) page. You can see the detailed stats (logs) and errors that your app is experiencing from there.
