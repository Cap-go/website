## What does the app page shows?

First, let's take a look at the main page of the app:

In Capgo, an app represents your mobile application integrated with Capgo's live update system. It allows you to manage updates, channels, and devices seamlessly.

Let's take a closer look at this. The main app page is divided into several key areas:

1.  **Top Navigation Bar:** Provides access to different sections of your app management:
    *   **Overview (1):** The current view, displaying key metrics and summaries.
    *   **Information (2):** Displays your app's core settings and details (see "App Information" section below).
    *   **[Bundles (3)](/docs/webapp/bundles/):** Manage your app's versions and releases.
    *   **[Channels (4)](/docs/webapp/channels/):** Configure and manage different update channels (e.g., production, beta).
    *   **[Devices (5)](/docs/webapp/devices/):** View and manage registered devices, including setting specific overrides.
    *   **[Logs (6)](/docs/webapp/logs/):** Access detailed logs and error reports for your app.

2.  **Statistics Display:** Visualizes important metrics for the last billing period (data reflects usage from your billing day, not the 1st of the month):
    *   **Monthly Active Users (7):** Tracks the number of unique active users over time.
    *   **Storage (8):** Shows the current storage consumption.
    *   **Bandwidth (9):** Displays the bandwidth usage.
    *   **Active Device by Bundle (10):** (Beta) Shows the distribution of active devices across different app bundles.

3.  **Summary Cards:** Offers a quick overview of key counts:
    *   **Channels (11):** Total number of configured channels.
    *   **Bundles (12):** Total number of app bundles.
    *   **Devices (13):** Total number of registered devices.
    *   **Updates (14):** Total number of updates performed.

## App Information

This section corresponds to the "Information" tab (2) in the top navigation bar. Here you can view and manage crucial details and settings for your application.

Here's a breakdown of the available fields and actions:

*   **App Icon:** Displays your application's icon. You can click the "Change" button to upload a new icon.
*   **App ID:** A unique identifier for your application within Capgo. This ID is not editable.
*   **App Name:** The display name for your application. You can modify this as needed.
*   **Default Upload Channel:** Specifies the default channel to which new bundles will be uploaded. You can click the edit icon to select a different default channel.
*   **Auto Delete Bundles Not Used (after x seconds):** This setting allows you to automatically delete old bundles that haven't been used for a specified duration (in seconds). This helps manage storage and keep your bundle list clean. `2592000` seconds is equivalent to 30 days.
*   **Transfer the application to another organisation:** This section provides an option to initiate the transfer of your application to a different organization you are a part of.
*   **Delete App Button:** Permanently deletes your application from Capgo. This action is irreversible and will remove all associated data, bundles, channels, and devices.
*   **Update Button:** Saves any changes you've made to the editable fields on this page (e.g., App Name, Default Upload Channel, Auto Delete Bundles setting).
