## Support by discord

Capgo has an official [discord server](https://discord.capgo.app). Getting tech support there is likely one of the fastest ways to get a response.

Here is a crash course:

Step 1 - go to the `questions` channel

Step 2 - create your thread

Step 3 - Describe your problem and select the relevant tags

Step 4 - Share your secure account id (optional)

This will allow the capgo staff to take a look at your account. Sharing this id is safe, as it was designed to be shared publicly.

To share this, please go to [capgo's settings](https://web.capgo.app/dashboard/settings/account/). There please click on `copy account id`.

This will copy the secure account id to the clipboard. Please include that in your discord post.

## Support by email

This is the slowest way to get support. Please use the discord server first.

If you need to contact us by email, please send an email to support@capgo.app.
