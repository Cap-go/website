Capgo's AudioSession plugin gives you fine-grained control over the iOS AVAudioSession layer so you can gracefully handle headphones, Bluetooth devices, and unexpected interruptions.

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Route awareness" icon="rocket">
    Detect when users plug or unplug headsets, AirPods, Bluetooth speakers, and more.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Speaker override" icon="setting">
    Force playback through the built-in speaker when you need hands-free audio.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Interruption handling" icon="moon">
    React to interruption events such as phone calls or Siri to pause and resume audio safely.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Type safety" icon="pencil">
    Strong TypeScript definitions make it easy to build resilient audio experiences.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

This plugin targets iOS where AVAudioSession control is required. On other platforms the calls resolve without effect, letting you keep one shared code path.
