<Aside type="tip">
  **Why Capacitor+?** Great PRs sit unmerged in the official Capacitor repository for months. Capacitor+ actively merges these community contributions so you don't have to wait.

## Philosophy

The Ionic team maintains Capacitor with their own priorities and release schedule. Community contributions can wait months or even years to be merged. Capacitor+ takes a different approach:

1. **Merge PRs from Forks** - Valuable PRs stuck in the upstream queue are actively merged
2. **Continuous Sync** - Every upstream change is automatically pulled and tested
3. **Rapid Releases** - Changes are published to npm as soon as they pass CI
4. **Community-First** - Your contributions matter and get prioritized
5. **Transparency** - All automation is open source and visible
