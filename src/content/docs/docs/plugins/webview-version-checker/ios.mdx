`@capgo/capacitor-webview-version-checker` currently targets Android runtime checks.

## Why

The plugin is designed for Android WebView provider compatibility flows:

- Detect active WebView provider package and version
- Compare against latest/minimum rules or device-share threshold
- Offer native prompt routing to provider update destination

iOS does not use the same update-provider model, so this plugin does not expose equivalent native enforcement there.
