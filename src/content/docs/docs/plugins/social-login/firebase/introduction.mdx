## Overview

This tutorial will guide you through setting up Firebase Authentication with the Capacitor Social Login plugin. This integration allows you to use native social login providers (Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter) on mobile platforms while leveraging Firebase Auth for backend authentication and Firestore for data storage.

## What You'll Learn

- How to configure Firebase Authentication
- How to integrate Capacitor Social Login plugin with Firebase Auth
- Platform-specific setup for Android, iOS, and Web

## What You'll Need

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. **A Firebase Project**
   - Create a project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Enable Authentication (Email/Password and Google Sign-In)
   - Get your Firebase configuration credentials

2. **Firebase JS SDK**
   - Install Firebase in your project:
     ```bash
     npm install firebase
     ```

3. **A Capacitor Project**
   - An existing Capacitor application
   - Capacitor Social Login plugin installed:
     ```bash
     npm install @capgo/capacitor-social-login
     npx cap sync
     ```

## Example Application

A complete working example is available in the repository:

**Code Repository**: [You can find the code repository here](https://github.com/Cap-go/capacitor-social-login/tree/main/example-app)

The example app demonstrates:
- Email/password authentication with Firebase
- Google Sign-In integration (Android, iOS, and Web)
- A simple key-value store using Firebase Firestore collections
- User-specific data storage in Firestore subcollections


## A word about using the Firebase SDK on Capacitor

When using the Firebase JS SDK on Capacitor, you need to be aware that when using the authentication methods, you need to initialize the Firebase Auth instance a bit differently.

On the web platform, you would use the `getAuth` function to get the Firebase Auth instance.

```typescript
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const auth = getAuth(app);
```

Unfortunately, on Capacitor, this does not work and causes Firebase auth to hang. As stated in [this blog post](https://harryherskowitz.com/2021/08/23/firebase-capacitor.html), you need to use the `initializeAuth` function to initialize the Firebase Auth instance.
This looks like this:

```typescript
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { initializeAuth } from 'firebase/auth';

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

function whichAuth() {
  let auth;
  if (Capacitor.isNativePlatform()) {
    auth = initializeAuth(app, {
      persistence: indexedDBLocalPersistence,
    });
  } else {
    auth = getAuth(app);
  }
  return auth;
}

export const auth = whichAuth();
```
