# Apple login on IOS

Configuring the web login is not trivial. It's more difficult than setting up `Sign in with Apple` on iOS but more difficult than setting up `Sign in with Apple` on Android.

## Generating the service

:::note
This step is redundent if you have already configured `Sign in with Apple` on Android.
:::

Please follow the guide [here](/docs/plugins/social-login/apple/android/#creating-the-service-id) to generate the service.

## Configuring the `Return URLs`

   :::caution
   This step is obligatory regardless of whether or not you have configured the `Sign in with Apple` on Android.
   :::

<Steps>
    1. Find your service ID. Open [the serivces page](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/serviceId) and click on your service ID.

    2. Click on the `Configure` button

    3. Click on the `Plus` button

    4. Add your website URL into both `Domains and Subdomains` and `Return URLs`
        <img src="/social-login-assets/apple_dev_web_auth_config_add_redirect.webp" alt="Adding website URL" />
        

        :::note
        You can add multiple URLs if you want to. The redirect URL is the url of the page where you will have your `Sign in with Apple` button.
        For example, this might be `https://magic-login-srvv2-48.localcan.dev/auth`
        :::


        :::caution
        You **MAY NOT** add the `http://localhost` URL. It will **NOT** work.
        :::

        :::caution
        When you add a redirect URL, you **MUST** add the `/` at the end of it otherwise it will **NOT** work.
        
        It's recommended to use both an URL with and without the trailing slash.
        :::

    5. Click on the `Next` button
        <img src="/social-login-assets/apple_dev_web_auth_conf_next_redirect.webp" alt="Save button" />
    6. Click on the `Done` button

## Using the `Sign in with Apple` in your app

:::note
I am using Vue as my framework, the exact implementation will vary depening on the framework of your choice
:::

<Steps>
    1. Add the following code to your component.
        ```ts
            //  onMounted is vue specific
            onMounted(() => {
            SocialLogin.initialize({
                apple: {}
            })
            });
        ```
    2. Create a button that will begin the login process.
        This button should call the following function.
        ```ts
            async function loginApple() {
                const res = await SocialLogin.login({
                    provider: 'apple',
                    options: {}
                })
        ```
</Steps>

You are done ðŸš€
