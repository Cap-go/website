You've been wondering if this plugin will ever be available for Cordova.

We have started a R\&D repository for that, but it's a huge amount of work.

## Problems

We know we can do it but for that, we have to read all the code of Cordova codebase as we did for Capacitor, to understand how to make it work with ap Capgo features.

The Android version is easier to do since both use Java, but iOS needs a full rewrite because Swift is still not well-supported in Cordova

## Solution

In the mean time heres what you can do:

* [Support us](https://github.com/sponsors/cap-go) on GitHub and we can prioritize that. 
This will need at least 1 month of work.
* Hire us as a [Consultant](https://capgo.app/consulting/), we are used to help big companies migrate to Capacitor, it usually takes a month, and the [benefit](https://ionic.io/resources/articles/capacitor-vs-cordova-modern-hybrid-app-development) is huge for your team
