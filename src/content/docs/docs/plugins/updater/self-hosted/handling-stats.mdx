## Statistics API

Starting from version 1.3.0 the update system is able to send stats!

By default, all stats are sent to our server, to understand usage and research. 

<Aside>
No private data is sent for stats, only random UUID, version update, version native app, platform, action, and app ID.
</Aside>

If you want to send this data to your server instead, change the config below:

```tsx
// capacitor.config.json
{
	"appId": "**.***.**",
	"appName": "Name",
	"plugins": {
		"CapacitorUpdater": {
			"statsUrl": "YOUR_URL"
		}
	}
}
```

## Data Structure

What your server will receive is:

```tsx
interface AppInfosStats {
	"action": "set", // can be set, delete, set_fail, reset, revert
	// Then it's the same info as update
	"app_id": "**.***.**", // app identifier in the store
	"device_id": "*******", // unique id per app install
	"platform": "ios", // or android
	"custom_id": "user_1", // represent your user
        "version_name": "1.2.3", // version of the web build
        "version_build": "1.2.0", // version of the native build
        "version_code": "120", // build number of the native build
	"version_os": "16", // OS version of the device
        "plugin_version": "4.0.0"// to make your api behave differently with different plugins
        "is_emulator": false,
    	"is_prod": false,
}
```

You can also totally disable it, with an empty string. Keep in mind, statistics are made private friendly and help me to understand how people use the plugin, to resolve issues and improve it.

## Implementation Example

Here is an example of code in JavaScript to save the stats of the plugin:

```typescript
interface AppInfos {
  version_name: string
  action: 'ping' |
          'delete' |
          'reset' |
          'set' |
          'get' |
          'set_fail' |
          'update_fail' |
          'download_fail' |
          'windows_path_fail' |
          'canonical_path_fail' |
          'directory_path_fail' |
          'unzip_fail' |
          'low_mem_fail' |
          'download_10' |
          'download_20' |
          'download_30' |
          'download_40' |
          'download_50' |
          'download_60' |
          'download_70' |
          'download_80' |
          'download_90' |
          'download_complete' |
          'decrypt_fail' |
          'app_moved_to_foreground' |
          'app_moved_to_background' |
          'uninstall' |
          'needPlanUpgrade' |
          'missingBundle' |
          'noNew' |
          'disablePlatformIos' |
          'disablePlatformAndroid' |
          'disableAutoUpdateToMajor' |
          'cannotUpdateViaPrivateChannel' |
          'disableAutoUpdateToMinor' |
          'disableAutoUpdateToPatch' |
          'channelMisconfigured' |
          'disableAutoUpdateMetadata' |
          'disableAutoUpdateUnderNative' |
          'disableDevBuild' |
          'disableEmulator' |
          'cannotGetBundle' |
          'checksum_fail' |
          'NoChannelOrOverride' |
          'setChannel' |
          'getChannel' |
          'rateLimited' |
          'disableAutoUpdate' |
          'InvalidIp' |
          'blocked_by_server_url'
  version_build: string
  version_code: string
  version_os: string
  plugin_version: string
  platform: string
  app_id: string
  device_id: string
  custom_id?: string
  is_prod?: boolean
  is_emulator?: boolean
}

export const handler: Handler = async (event) => {
  const body = JSON.parse(event.body || '{}') as AppInfos
  const {
    platform,
    app_id,
    action,
    version_code,
    version_os,
    device_id,
    version_name,
    version_build,
    plugin_version,
  } = body
  console.log('update asked', platform,
    app_id,
    action,
    version_os,
    version_code,
    device_id,
    version_name,
    version_build,
    plugin_version)
  // Save it in your database
  return { status: 'ok' }
}
```

This endpoint should return a JSON:

```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```
