The Capacitor Barometer plugin provides access to device barometric pressure sensors, allowing you to read atmospheric pressure and calculate altitude changes.

## Key Features

- **Pressure Monitoring** - Real-time atmospheric pressure readings
- **Altitude Calculation** - Derive relative altitude from pressure changes
- **Event Listeners** - Subscribe to pressure change events
- **Cross-Platform** - Works on iOS and Android devices with barometer sensors

## Installation

```bash
npm install @capgo/capacitor-barometer
npx cap sync
```

## Platform Support

- **iOS**: Requires device with barometer (iPhone 6 and newer)
- **Android**: Requires device with pressure sensor
- **Web**: Not supported (no browser API for barometer access)

## Use Cases

- **Weather Apps** - Display local atmospheric pressure
- **Fitness Tracking** - Monitor altitude during outdoor activities
- **Navigation** - Enhance GPS with pressure-based altitude
- **Health Apps** - Track elevation changes during exercise

## API Overview

The plugin provides methods to:
- Start/stop pressure monitoring
- Get current pressure readings
- Calculate altitude changes
- Listen to pressure events

## Next Steps

Get started with the [Getting Started guide](/docs/plugins/barometer/getting-started) to integrate barometer functionality into your Capacitor app.
