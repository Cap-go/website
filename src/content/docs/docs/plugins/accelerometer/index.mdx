The Capacitor Accelerometer plugin provides access to device accelerometer sensors, allowing you to read acceleration forces in three dimensions and detect device motion.

## Key Features

- **3-Axis Acceleration** - X, Y, Z axis measurements
- **Real-time Updates** - Continuous acceleration monitoring
- **Motion Detection** - Detect shakes, tilts, and movements
- **Cross-Platform** - iOS, Android, and Web support

## Installation

```bash
npm install @capgo/capacitor-accelerometer
npx cap sync
```

## Platform Support

- **iOS**: Full support (all devices)
- **Android**: Full support (all devices)
- **Web**: Supported via DeviceMotion API

## Use Cases

- **Fitness Apps** - Track movement and activity
- **Games** - Motion-based controls and gestures
- **Navigation** - Detect orientation changes
- **Health Monitoring** - Fall detection and activity tracking

## API Overview

The plugin provides methods to:
- Start/stop acceleration monitoring
- Read current acceleration values
- Configure update intervals
- Listen to acceleration events

## Next Steps

Get started with the [Getting Started guide](/docs/plugins/accelerometer/getting-started) to integrate accelerometer functionality into your Capacitor app.
