**@capgo/capacitor-fast-sql** is a high-performance native SQLite plugin that uses a custom HTTP-based communication protocol to bypass Capacitor's standard bridge, delivering up to 25x faster performance for large datasets and sync operations.

## Why Fast SQL?

Traditional Capacitor plugins serialize data through the JavaScript bridge, which becomes inefficient with large datasets. Fast SQL solves this by establishing a local HTTP server for direct native communication, making it ideal for:

- **Local-first sync systems** (CRDTs, operational transforms)
- **IndexedDB replacement** on platforms with broken/limited implementations
- **Large dataset operations** requiring high throughput
- **Batch operations** with thousands of rows
- **Binary data storage** (BLOBs, files)

## Performance

Fast SQL uses a custom HTTP protocol inspired by [capacitor-blob-writer](https://github.com/diachedelic/capacitor-blob-writer) that eliminates serialization overhead:

- **25x faster** for large batch operations
- **Direct binary transfer** without base64 encoding
- **Efficient memory usage** for streaming large results
- **Local HTTP server** on iOS/Android for optimal throughput

## Use Cases

### Local-First Applications
Build apps that work offline-first with efficient sync capabilities:
- CouchDB/PouchDB-style replication
- Operational transform systems
- CRDT-based collaboration tools

### IndexedDB Replacement
Replace unreliable IndexedDB implementations with native SQLite:
- Cross-platform consistency
- Better performance on mobile
- Reliable transactions and data integrity

### High-Performance Data
Handle large datasets efficiently:
- Analytics and reporting
- Import/export operations
- Data migration tools
- Scientific data collection
