Introductory offers allow you to provide eligible users with either a free trial or a discounted introductory price. After the introductory period concludes, subscriptions automatically renew at standard pricing unless cancelled.

## Overview

Introductory offers are a powerful tool to:
- Reduce barriers to entry for new subscribers
- Increase conversion rates
- Allow users to try your premium features risk-free
- Build long-term subscriber relationships

## Eligibility

Users can receive an introductory offer if they haven't previously purchased or received an introductory offer for the subscription. Google Play handles eligibility automatically.

## Prerequisites

You must first [create an auto-renewable subscription](/docs/plugins/native-purchases/android-create-subscription/) before adding an introductory offer.

## Creating an Introductory Offer

<Steps>

1. **Access Offer Configuration**

   Navigate to your subscription in Google Play Console and select the **Add offer** button.

   ![Add offer button](/native-purchases/android/introductory-offer/add-offer-button.webp)

2. **Select Base Plan**

   A modal will appear requiring you to choose your base plan. Typically, you'll only have one base plan. Click **Add offer** to continue.

3. **Configure Offer Details**

   Enter the following information:

   **Offer ID**: A unique identifier for this offer

   **Eligibility**: Choose who can receive this offer
   - **New customers**: Only users who have never subscribed
   - **Existing customers**: Users who previously subscribed
   - **Developer determined**: Custom eligibility logic (not supported by native-purchases)

   :::caution
   The native-purchases plugin does not support the "Developer determined" eligibility option. Use "New customers" or "Existing customers" instead.

4. **Add Phases**

   Click **Add phase** at the bottom of the page to define your offer structure.

   You can add up to two phases, allowing combinations like:
   - Free trial only
   - Discounted price only
   - Free trial followed by discounted recurring payment

5. **Select Phase Type**

   Choose from three phase types:

   **Free Trial**
   - Complimentary access for a set duration
   - Example: 7 days free, then $9.99/month

   **Single Payment**
   - One-time discounted price for a specific period
   - Example: $1.99 for 2 months, then $9.99/month

   **Discounted Recurring Payment**
   - Reduced per-billing-cycle rate for multiple cycles
   - Example: $4.99/month for 3 months, then $9.99/month

6. **Configure Phase Duration**

   Set how long the introductory phase lasts:
   - Days, weeks, or months
   - Number of billing cycles

7. **Finalize and Activate**

   Click **Apply**, then **Save** to activate the offer. The **Activate** button will become available once saved.

</Steps>

## Offer Phase Examples

### Example 1: Simple Free Trial
- Phase 1: 7 days free
- Then: $9.99/month standard pricing

### Example 2: Discounted Introduction
- Phase 1: $1.99 for the first month
- Then: $9.99/month standard pricing

### Example 3: Extended Trial + Discount
- Phase 1: 14 days free
- Phase 2: $4.99/month for 2 months
- Then: $9.99/month standard pricing

## Using in Your App

The native-purchases plugin automatically handles introductory offer eligibility and presentation:

```typescript
import { NativePurchases } from '@capgo/native-purchases';

// Check eligibility
const { eligible } = await NativePurchases.checkTrialOrIntroductoryPriceEligibility({
  productIdentifiers: ['premium_monthly']
});

if (eligible['premium_monthly']) {
  console.log('User is eligible for introductory offer!');
}

// Fetch products (includes intro offer info)
const { products } = await NativePurchases.getProducts({
  productIdentifiers: ['premium_monthly']
});

const product = products[0];
if (product.introductoryPrice) {
  console.log(`Intro offer: ${product.introductoryPriceString}`);
  console.log(`Then: ${product.priceString}`);
}

// Purchase (intro offer applied automatically if eligible)
const { customerInfo } = await NativePurchases.purchaseProduct({
  productIdentifier: 'premium_monthly'
});
```

## Best Practices

### Offer Duration
- **Free trials**: 3-14 days is optimal for most apps
- **Discounted periods**: 1-3 months works well for building habit
- **Price discount**: 50-70% off regular price drives conversions

### Marketing
- Clearly display the intro offer and regular price
- Show what happens after the intro period
- Make cancellation easy and transparent
- Remind users before the intro period ends

### A/B Testing
Test different offer structures:
- Free trial length
- Discount percentage
- Discount duration
- Single phase vs. multi-phase

## Important Notes

- Only one introductory offer can be active per subscription at a time
- Users can only claim an intro offer once per subscription
- Intro offers don't apply to subscription upgrades/downgrades
- Changes to intro offers don't affect existing subscribers

## Troubleshooting

**Intro offer not showing:**
- Verify the offer is activated in Play Console
- Check user eligibility (may have used offer before)
- Ensure app is using latest product information

**Wrong users receiving offer:**
- Review eligibility settings (new vs. existing customers)
- Check if user previously subscribed on different device
- Verify Play Store account history

**Offer not applying at purchase:**
- Confirm product ID matches exactly
- Check that offer is still active and not expired
- Verify date range settings for the offer

## Next Steps

- [Configure sandbox testing](/docs/plugins/native-purchases/android-sandbox-testing/) to test your offers
- Monitor conversion rates in Play Console analytics
- Consider creating multiple subscription tiers with different offers
