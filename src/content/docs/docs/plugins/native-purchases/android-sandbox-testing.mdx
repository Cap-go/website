Testing in-app purchases requires proper configuration in Google Play Console. This guide will walk you through setting up sandbox testing for your Android app.

## Prerequisites

You need an active Google Play Console account with a current subscription (renewed annually).

## Setup Process

<Steps>

1. **Add Testing Account**

   Navigate to your Google Play Console, select your app, and go to **Setup > License testing**.

   Add the primary Google account associated with the Android device you're using for testing.

2. **Create Testing Track**

   Go to **Testing > Closed testing** or **Testing > Internal testing** and create a new track.

   You must upload at least one signed version of your app to this track.

3. **Create Tester List**

   After setting up the testing track, create an email list and add the testing device's account email address.

4. **Join Testing Program**

   Open the opt-in URL from your test device and click the **"Become a tester"** button to enroll.

5. **Upload Signed APK**

   Generate a signed APK or use Android App Bundle to upload your app to the testing track.

   Rolling out isn't required - just upload and await approval.

6. **Build and Test**

   Run your app on the test device. When attempting a purchase, you should see a message:

   > "This is a test order; you will not be charged."

   ![Test purchase](/native-purchases/android/sandbox-testing/test-purchase-confirmation.webp)

</Steps>

## Important Notes

- Test accounts will not be charged for purchases
- Test purchases use the same flow as production purchases
- You can test all subscription features including trials and introductory offers
- Test subscriptions have accelerated renewal periods for faster testing

## Troubleshooting

**Products not showing in test mode:**
- Ensure your app is uploaded to a testing track
- Verify the test account is added to License testing
- Check that products are active in Google Play Console

**"Item not available" error:**
- Wait 2-3 hours after creating products for them to become available
- Ensure your app's package name matches the one in Play Console
- Verify you're signed in with a test account

**Test purchases showing as real charges:**
- Double-check the account is added to License testing
- Ensure you're using the build from the testing track
- Verify the testing banner appears during purchase
