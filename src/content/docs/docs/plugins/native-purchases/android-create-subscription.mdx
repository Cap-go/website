Auto-renewable subscriptions provide access to content, services, or premium features in your app on an ongoing basis. This guide will help you create and configure subscriptions in Google Play Console.

## Overview

Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period until the user cancels. They're ideal for:
- Premium content access
- Ad-free experiences
- Cloud storage
- Ongoing services

## Creating a Subscription

<Steps>

1. **Navigate to Subscriptions**

   In Google Play Console, select your app and choose **Monetize > Subscriptions** from the left menu.

   Click the **Create subscription** button to begin.

2. **Enter Basic Information**

   Provide a subscription name and product ID. The product ID is required for configuration in your app and cannot be changed later.

   ![Enter subscription details](/native-purchases/android/create-subscription/enter-subscription-details.webp)

3. **Create Base Plan**

   Google Play requires exactly one base plan per subscription. The native-purchases plugin supports only one base plan to maintain compatibility with iOS.

   Click **Add base plan** to continue.

4. **Configure Base Plan Details**

   Enter:
   - **Base plan ID**: Unique identifier for this plan
   - **Billing period**: How often users are charged (weekly, monthly, yearly, etc.)
   - **Grace period**: Time window during which Google maintains the subscription while retrying payment before cancellation

5. **Set Up Pricing**

   Access the pricing section and select all countries/regions where you want to offer the subscription.

   ![Select regions](/native-purchases/android/create-subscription/select-pricing-regions.webp)

6. **Configure Price**

   Set your base price in your primary currency. Google Play automatically converts this to local currencies.

   ![Set price](/native-purchases/android/create-subscription/set-base-price.webp)

7. **Review Regional Pricing**

   Review the automatically converted prices for each country. You can adjust individual prices if needed.

8. **Save Configuration**

   Save your pricing configuration.

9. **Activate Subscription**

   Click the **Activate** button to make your subscription product live and available for purchase.

</Steps>

## Important Considerations

### Base Plan Limitation

The native-purchases plugin requires exactly one base plan per subscription to ensure consistency with iOS subscription handling. Multiple base plans are not supported.

### Grace Period

The grace period allows Google Play to retry failed payments while maintaining the user's subscription access. Common grace periods are:
- 3 days for monthly subscriptions
- 7 days for longer subscriptions

### Subscription Status

After creation, your subscription will be in "Draft" status until activated. You can test draft subscriptions in sandbox mode.

## Using in Your App

Once created, reference the subscription in your app using the product ID:

```typescript
import { NativePurchases, PURCHASE_TYPE } from '@capgo/native-purchases';

// Load subscription info
const { products } = await NativePurchases.getProducts({
  productIdentifiers: ['com.example.premium.monthly'],
  productType: PURCHASE_TYPE.SUBS,
});

const product = products[0];
console.log(`${product.title} — ${product.priceString}`);

// Purchase (planIdentifier = Base Plan ID from Google Play Console)
const transaction = await NativePurchases.purchaseProduct({
  productIdentifier: 'com.example.premium.monthly',
  planIdentifier: 'monthly-plan', // REQUIRED on Android, ignored on iOS
  productType: PURCHASE_TYPE.SUBS,
});

console.log('Transaction ID', transaction.transactionId);

// Later, check purchase state
const { purchases } = await NativePurchases.getPurchases({
  productType: PURCHASE_TYPE.SUBS,
});

const subscription = purchases.find(
  (purchase) => purchase.productIdentifier === 'com.example.premium.monthly',
);

if (subscription && subscription.purchaseState === 'PURCHASED' && subscription.isAcknowledged) {
  console.log('Subscription active locally');
  // For expiration/cancellation, validate purchaseToken through your backend
}
```

## Next Steps

- [Create an introductory offer](/docs/plugins/native-purchases/android-introductory-offer/) to attract new subscribers
- [Configure sandbox testing](/docs/plugins/native-purchases/android-sandbox-testing/) to test your subscriptions
- Set up backend receipt validation for security

## Troubleshooting

**Subscription not appearing in app:**
- Verify the product ID matches exactly
- Ensure the subscription is activated
- Check that your app has the correct package name
- Wait 2-3 hours after activation for changes to propagate

**Base plan errors:**
- Ensure you have exactly one base plan
- Verify all required fields are filled
- Check that billing period is valid

**Pricing issues:**
- Confirm at least one country is selected
- Verify base price is greater than minimum allowed
- Check currency conversion rates are acceptable
