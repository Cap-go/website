Testing in-app purchases on iOS requires proper configuration in App Store Connect and on your test devices. This guide covers everything you need to get started with sandbox testing.

## Prerequisites

- **Apple Developer Program**: Active membership with annual renewal
- **Agreements**: Signed "Paid Applications Agreement" with banking and tax information completed
- **Xcode Project**: Configured with proper bundle identifier and capabilities

:::note
Banking and tax setup approval can take hours to days. Complete this well in advance of testing.
:::

## Setup Process

<Steps>

1. **Sign Paid Applications Agreement**

   In App Store Connect, navigate to **Agreements, Tax, and Banking** and complete:
   - Sign the Paid Applications Agreement
   - Add your banking information
   - Complete tax forms

   Wait for Apple to approve your information (this can take 24-48 hours).

2. **Create Sandbox Test User**

   In App Store Connect, go to **Users and Access > Sandbox Testers**.

   Click the **+** button to create a new sandbox tester.

   **Important**: Use an email address that is NOT already associated with an Apple ID. You can use email aliases:
   - Gmail: `youremail+test@gmail.com`
   - iCloud: `youremail+test@icloud.com`

3. **Configure Test Device (iOS 12+)**

   Starting with iOS 12, you no longer need to sign out of your iTunes account to test purchases.

   On your iOS device:
   1. Open **Settings**
   2. Tap **App Store**
   3. Scroll to the bottom
   4. Tap **Sandbox Account**
   5. Sign in with your sandbox test account

   :::tip
   This is much more convenient than the old method of signing out of your iTunes account!
   :::

4. **Configure Xcode Project**

   Ensure your Xcode project has:

   **Bundle Identifier**
   - Must match the identifier in your Developer Center
   - Must match the identifier in App Store Connect

   **In-App Purchase Capability**
   1. Select your project in Xcode
   2. Go to **Signing & Capabilities**
   3. Click **+ Capability**
   4. Add **In-App Purchase**

5. **Create In-App Purchase Products**

   In App Store Connect, navigate to your app and create your in-app purchase products (subscriptions, consumables, etc.).

   Products must be in at least "Ready to Submit" status for sandbox testing.

6. **Test Your Implementation**

   Build and run your app on a test device. When you attempt a purchase, you should see:

   > **[Environment: Sandbox]**

   This confirmation indicates you're in the sandbox environment and won't be charged real money.

</Steps>

## Important Notes

### Sandbox Environment Characteristics

- **No real charges**: All purchases are free in sandbox mode
- **Accelerated subscriptions**: Subscription durations are shortened for faster testing
  - 1 week subscription = 3 minutes
  - 1 month subscription = 5 minutes
  - 2 months subscription = 10 minutes
  - 3 months subscription = 15 minutes
  - 6 months subscription = 30 minutes
  - 1 year subscription = 1 hour
- **Auto-renewal limit**: Subscriptions auto-renew up to 6 times in sandbox
- **Immediate cancellation**: Cancelled subscriptions expire immediately

### Sandbox Account Management

- Create multiple test accounts for different scenarios
- Use test accounts only on test devices
- Don't use personal Apple ID for sandbox testing
- Test accounts can purchase any product regardless of region

## Using Sandbox Testing

```typescript
import { NativePurchases } from '@capgo/native-purchases';

// Initialize (works in both sandbox and production)
await NativePurchases.configure({
  apiKey: 'your_api_key_here'
});

// Fetch products (automatically uses sandbox when available)
const { products } = await NativePurchases.getProducts({
  productIdentifiers: ['premium_monthly']
});

// Make test purchase
const { customerInfo } = await NativePurchases.purchaseProduct({
  productIdentifier: 'premium_monthly'
});

console.log('Test purchase successful!', customerInfo);
```

## Verification

When properly configured, you should observe:

1. **Sandbox banner** during purchase: "[Environment: Sandbox]"
2. **Products load** successfully
3. **Purchases complete** without actual charges
4. **Receipts validate** correctly
5. **Subscriptions renew** automatically (at accelerated rate)

## Troubleshooting

**Products not loading:**
- Verify bundle identifier matches App Store Connect
- Check that agreements are signed and approved
- Ensure products are at least "Ready to Submit" status
- Wait 2-3 hours after creating products

**"Cannot connect to iTunes Store":**
- Verify sandbox account is configured correctly
- Check device is connected to internet
- Try signing out and back into sandbox account
- Restart the app

**Purchases failing silently:**
- Check Xcode console for error messages
- Verify In-App Purchase capability is enabled
- Ensure sandbox account email is not a real Apple ID
- Try creating a new sandbox test account

**Receipt validation errors:**
- Use sandbox receipt validation endpoint in testing
- Production endpoint: `https://buy.itunes.apple.com/verifyReceipt`
- Sandbox endpoint: `https://sandbox.itunes.apple.com/verifyReceipt`
- The native-purchases plugin handles this automatically

**Wrong subscription duration:**
- Remember subscriptions are accelerated in sandbox
- Use the conversion chart above for expected durations
- Subscriptions auto-renew max 6 times in sandbox

**"This Apple ID has not yet been used in the iTunes Store":**
- This is normal for new sandbox accounts
- Proceed with the purchase to activate the account
- Only happens on first use

## Best Practices

1. **Create multiple test accounts** for different test scenarios
2. **Test all subscription durations** to verify behavior
3. **Test cancellation and renewal** flows
4. **Verify receipt validation** works correctly
5. **Test restore purchases** functionality
6. **Check subscription upgrade/downgrade** behavior
7. **Test with poor network conditions**

## Production vs. Sandbox

| Feature | Sandbox | Production |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Real charges | No | Yes |
| Subscription duration | Accelerated | Normal |
| Auto-renewal limit | 6 times | Unlimited |
| Cancellation effect | Immediate | End of period |
| Receipt endpoint | Sandbox URL | Production URL |
| Test accounts only | Yes | No |
