Auto-renewable subscriptions provide recurring access to content, services, or premium features in your iOS app. This guide walks you through creating subscriptions in App Store Connect.

## Overview

Auto-renewable subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period until users cancel. They're perfect for:
- Premium content and features
- Ad-free experiences
- Cloud storage and sync
- Streaming services
- Professional tools and utilities

## Prerequisites

Before creating subscriptions, you must:
1. [Create a subscription group](/docs/plugins/native-purchases/ios-subscription-group/) to organize your subscriptions
2. Have an active Apple Developer Program membership
3. Complete banking and tax information in App Store Connect

## Creating a Subscription

<Steps>

1. **Navigate to Subscriptions**

   In App Store Connect, select your app and go to **Monetize > Subscriptions**.

   Select your subscription group or create a new one if needed.

2. **Create New Subscription**

   Click the **+** icon next to your subscription group to add a new subscription.

3. **Enter Basic Information**

   **Reference Name**: Descriptive name for your internal use (not shown to customers)
   - Examples: "Premium Monthly", "Ultimate Annual", "Basic Plan"

   **Product ID**: Unique identifier for this subscription (cannot be changed later)
   - Format: `com.yourcompany.yourapp.premium_monthly`
   - Use descriptive, lowercase names with underscores
   - Required for configuring the native-purchases plugin

   ![Enter subscription details](/native-purchases/ios/create-subscription/enter-subscription-info.webp)

4. **Configure Duration**

   Select the subscription duration from available options:
   - 1 week
   - 1 month
   - 2 months
   - 3 months
   - 6 months
   - 1 year

   The duration determines how often users are billed.

5. **Set Up Pricing**

   Click **Add Subscription Price** to configure pricing:

   **Base Territory**: Select your primary market (usually your country)

   **Price**: Set the subscription price
   - Apple automatically converts to other currencies
   - Choose from Apple's price tiers
   - Consider perceived value and market rates

   ![Configure pricing](/native-purchases/ios/create-subscription/configure-pricing.webp)

6. **Family Sharing (Optional)**

   Decide whether to enable Family Sharing, which allows up to 6 family members to access the subscription.

   :::caution
   Once Family Sharing is enabled, it cannot be turned off for this product.
   :::

   **Enable if:**
   - Content is appropriate for family use
   - You want to increase value proposition
   - Your business model supports it

   **Don't enable if:**
   - Subscription is for individual use only
   - Content is personalized to the user
   - You want to maximize revenue per user

7. **Add Localizations**

   Add subscription display information in all languages your app supports:

   **Subscription Display Name**: Customer-facing name (e.g., "Premium Monthly")

   **Description**: Brief description of what the subscription includes
   - Keep it concise and benefit-focused
   - Mention key features
   - Highlight value proposition

   ![Add localizations](/native-purchases/ios/create-subscription/add-localization.webp)

8. **App Store Promotional Image (Optional)**

   Upload a promotional image for this subscription (312x390 pixels):
   - Shows in the App Store subscription page
   - Should match your app's design
   - Include subscription name for clarity

   :::note
   While images are optional for initial submission, they're required for promotional display in the App Store. You can add them later.
   :::

9. **Save and Submit**

   Click **Save** to create the subscription.

   **For First Subscription:**
   - Must be submitted with a new app version
   - Include in your next App Store submission
   - Cannot submit independently

   **For Subsequent Subscriptions:**
   - Can be submitted directly from the Subscriptions page
   - Don't require a new app version
   - Available after first subscription is approved

</Steps>

## Subscription Status

Your subscription will have one of these statuses:

| Status | Description | Can Test? |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Missing Metadata** | Incomplete setup | Yes (sandbox) |
| **Ready to Submit** | Complete but not submitted | Yes (sandbox) |
| **Waiting for Review** | Submitted to Apple | Yes (sandbox) |
| **In Review** | Being reviewed by Apple | Yes (sandbox) |
| **Approved** | Available for purchase | Yes |
| **Rejected** | Needs changes | Yes (sandbox) |

:::tip
You can test subscriptions in sandbox mode even if they show "Missing Metadata" or "Ready to Submit"!
:::

## Using in Your App

Once created, reference the subscription in your app using the product ID:

```typescript
import { NativePurchases } from '@capgo/native-purchases';

// Fetch subscription products
const { products } = await NativePurchases.getProducts({
  productIdentifiers: [
    'com.yourcompany.yourapp.premium_monthly',
    'com.yourcompany.yourapp.premium_annual'
  ]
});

// Display subscription details
products.forEach(product => {
  console.log(`${product.title}: ${product.priceString}`);
  console.log(`Duration: ${product.subscriptionPeriod}`);
  console.log(`Description: ${product.description}`);
});

// Purchase a subscription
try {
  const { customerInfo } = await NativePurchases.purchaseProduct({
    productIdentifier: 'com.yourcompany.yourapp.premium_monthly'
  });

  // Check entitlements
  if (customerInfo.entitlements.active['premium']) {
    console.log('Premium subscription active!');
    // Enable premium features
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Purchase failed:', error);
}

// Check subscription status
const { customerInfo } = await NativePurchases.getCustomerInfo();
const premiumEntitlement = customerInfo.entitlements.active['premium'];

if (premiumEntitlement) {
  console.log('Expires:', premiumEntitlement.expirationDate);
  console.log('Will renew:', premiumEntitlement.willRenew);
  console.log('Product:', premiumEntitlement.productIdentifier);
}
```

## Best Practices

### Pricing Strategy
- **Monthly plans**: Lower barrier to entry, builds habit
- **Annual plans**: Better value, higher LTV, lower churn
- **Multiple tiers**: Basic, Premium, Ultimate for different user segments
- **Competitive analysis**: Research similar apps' pricing

### Product IDs
- Use consistent naming: `company.app.tier_duration`
- Include tier and duration in ID: `premium_monthly`, `ultimate_annual`
- Avoid changing product IDs (they're permanent)
- Document all product IDs for your team

### Family Sharing
- Enable for family-oriented apps (games, educational, entertainment)
- Consider impact on revenue
- Test sharing behavior thoroughly
- Communicate sharing capability in marketing

### Localization
- Translate all subscription names and descriptions
- Consider regional pricing differences
- Test display in all supported languages
- Use culturally appropriate marketing language

### Promotional Images
- Maintain consistent visual style
- Include subscription name and key benefit
- Update for seasonal promotions
- Match app's overall design language

## Common Subscription Patterns

### Single Tier (Freemium)
```
Free App + Premium Subscription
- Basic: Free (limited features)
- Premium Monthly: $4.99
- Premium Annual: $39.99 (save 33%)
```

### Multi-Tier (Good, Better, Best)
```
- Basic Monthly: $4.99
- Premium Monthly: $9.99
- Ultimate Monthly: $19.99

```

### Consumable + Subscription Hybrid
```

- Annual subscription (unlimited + bonus features)
```

## Troubleshooting

**Subscription not loading in app:**
- Verify product ID matches exactly (case-sensitive)

- Ensure bundle identifier matches App Store Connect
- Wait 2-3 hours after creating product

**Cannot submit subscription:**
- Complete all required fields (name, description, price)
- Add at least one localization
- Verify banking/tax info is approved
- Check if first subscription (requires app version)

**Family Sharing toggle disabled:**
- Already enabled (cannot be disabled)
- Check in subscription details
- Contact Apple Support if stuck

**Price tier not available:**
- May be restricted in some territories
- Choose alternative tier
- Contact Apple for pricing questions

**"Invalid Product ID" error:**
- Must be reverse domain format
- Cannot contain spaces or special characters
- Check for typos
- Verify uniqueness across all products
