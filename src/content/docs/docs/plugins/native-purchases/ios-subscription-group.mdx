Subscription groups are essential for organizing and managing multiple subscription levels in your iOS app. Understanding how they work is crucial for implementing upgrade, downgrade, and crossgrade functionality.

## What is a Subscription Group?

A subscription group is a collection of related subscriptions that users can choose between. Users can only subscribe to one subscription within a group at a time. When they switch subscriptions, Apple handles the transition automatically.

## Why Subscription Groups Matter

Subscription groups enable:
- **Tiered pricing**: Offer basic, premium, and ultimate plans
- **Different durations**: Monthly, yearly, and lifetime options
- **Upgrade/downgrade logic**: Automatic handling of subscription changes
- **Simplified management**: Group related subscriptions together

## Subscription Levels

Within a group, each subscription should be ranked from highest value (level 1) to lowest value. This ranking determines how subscription changes are classified:

### Level Examples

**Level 1** (Highest Value)
- Premium Annual ($99.99/year)
- Ultimate Monthly ($19.99/month)

**Level 2** (Medium Value)
- Standard Annual ($49.99/year)
- Premium Monthly ($9.99/month)

**Level 3** (Lowest Value)
- Basic Annual ($29.99/year)
- Standard Monthly ($4.99/month)

## Subscription Change Types

Apple automatically handles three types of subscription changes based on the level ranking:

### 1. Upgrade
Moving to a **higher-tier** subscription (e.g., level 2 → level 1).

**Behavior:**
- Takes effect **immediately**
- User receives **prorated refund** for remaining time
- New subscription starts right away

**Example:**
```typescript
// User currently has: Standard Monthly (Level 2)
// User upgrades to: Premium Annual (Level 1)
// Result: Immediate access to Premium, refund for unused Standard time
```

### 2. Downgrade
Moving to a **lower-tier** subscription (e.g., level 1 → level 2).

**Behavior:**
- Takes effect at **next renewal date**
- User keeps current subscription until period ends
- New subscription starts automatically after expiration

**Example:**
```typescript
// User currently has: Premium Annual (Level 1)
// User downgrades to: Standard Monthly (Level 2)
// Result: Premium access continues until annual renewal date, then switches
```

### 3. Crossgrade
Switching to another subscription **at the same tier level**.

**Behavior depends on duration:**

**Different Duration** → Behaves like **downgrade**
- Takes effect at next renewal date
- Example: Monthly Premium (Level 1) → Annual Premium (Level 1)

**Same Duration** → Behaves like **upgrade**
- Takes effect immediately
- Example: Premium Monthly (Level 1) → Ultimate Monthly (Level 1)

## Creating a Subscription Group

<Steps>

1. **Navigate to Subscriptions**

   In App Store Connect, select your app and go to **Monetize > Subscriptions**.

2. **Create Group**

   Click **+** next to "Subscription Groups" to create a new group.

3. **Name the Group**

   Choose a descriptive name that reflects the subscriptions it contains:
   - "Premium Access"
   - "Cloud Storage Plans"
   - "Pro Features"

4. **Add Subscriptions**

   After creating the group, add individual subscriptions to it. Each subscription will have a level ranking.

5. **Set Level Rankings**

   Arrange subscriptions from highest value (1) to lowest value. Consider:
   - Annual plans typically rank higher than monthly
   - Higher-priced tiers rank above lower-priced ones
   - Ultimate/premium tiers rank highest

</Steps>

## Using in Your App

The native-purchases plugin automatically handles subscription group logic:

```typescript
import { NativePurchases } from '@capgo/native-purchases';

// Fetch all subscriptions in a group
const { products } = await NativePurchases.getProducts({
  productIdentifiers: [
    'premium_monthly',
    'premium_annual',
    'ultimate_monthly'
  ]
});

// Display current subscription
const { customerInfo } = await NativePurchases.getCustomerInfo();
const activeSubs = customerInfo.activeSubscriptions;

// Check for pending downgrade
if (customerInfo.subscriptionRenewalProduct) {
  console.log('Subscription will change to:',
    customerInfo.subscriptionRenewalProduct);
}

// Purchase (automatically handles upgrade/downgrade)
await NativePurchases.purchaseProduct({
  productIdentifier: 'premium_annual'
});

// Listen for subscription changes
NativePurchases.addListener('customerInfoUpdate', (info) => {
  console.log('Subscription updated:', info.customerInfo);
});
```

## Handling Subscription Changes

### Detecting Change Type

```typescript
// Get current subscription info
const { customerInfo } = await NativePurchases.getCustomerInfo();

// Check if downgrade is pending
if (customerInfo.subscriptionRenewalProduct) {
  // User has downgraded, will change at next renewal
  const currentProduct = customerInfo.activeSubscriptions[0];
  const futureProduct = customerInfo.subscriptionRenewalProduct;

  console.log(`Currently: ${currentProduct}`);
  console.log(`Changes to: ${futureProduct} at next renewal`);
}

// Check for immediate upgrade
NativePurchases.addListener('customerInfoUpdate', (info) => {
  // This fires immediately for upgrades
  console.log('Subscription changed!');
});
```

### User Communication

Always communicate the change behavior clearly:

**For Upgrades:**
> "You'll get immediate access to Premium features. We'll prorate your current subscription."

**For Downgrades:**
> "You'll keep Premium access until [renewal date], then switch to Standard."

**For Crossgrades:**
> "Your plan will change to Annual billing at the next renewal on [date]."

## Webhooks

The native-purchases plugin triggers webhooks for subscription changes:

```typescript
// subscription_replace webhook fired when user changes subscriptions
{
  "type": "subscription_replace",
  "oldProduct": "premium_monthly",
  "newProduct": "premium_annual",
  "effectiveDate": "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z",
  "isUpgrade": false // Crossgrade (monthly to annual)
}
```

## Best Practices

### Group Organization
- Keep related subscriptions in the same group
- Don't mix unrelated features (e.g., storage and ad removal)
- Create separate groups for different feature sets

### Level Ranking Strategy
- Annual plans → Higher level than monthly (for same tier)
- Higher-priced tiers → Higher level
- Consider value, not just price

### User Experience
- Show current subscription clearly
- Display all available options in the group
- Indicate which changes are immediate vs. at renewal
- Allow easy switching between plans

### Testing
- Test all upgrade scenarios
- Test all downgrade scenarios
- Verify crossgrade behavior
- Check webhook firing

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Three-Tier Monthly Plans
```
Level 1: Ultimate Monthly ($19.99)
Level 2: Premium Monthly ($9.99)
Level 3: Basic Monthly ($4.99)
```

- Basic → Premium: Upgrade (immediate)
- Premium → Ultimate: Upgrade (immediate)
- Ultimate → Premium: Downgrade (at renewal)
- Basic → Ultimate: Upgrade (immediate)

### Scenario 2: Mixed Duration Plans
```
Level 1: Premium Annual ($99.99/year)
Level 2: Premium Monthly ($9.99/month)
```

- Monthly → Annual: Crossgrade (at renewal)
- Annual → Monthly: Downgrade (at renewal)

### Scenario 3: Multi-Tier Multi-Duration
```
Level 1: Ultimate Annual ($199/year)
Level 2: Ultimate Monthly ($19.99/month)
Level 3: Premium Annual ($99/year)
Level 4: Premium Monthly ($9.99/month)
Level 5: Basic Annual ($49/year)
Level 6: Basic Monthly ($4.99/month)
```

This setup provides maximum flexibility while maintaining clear upgrade/downgrade logic.

## Troubleshooting

**Subscription not appearing in group:**
- Verify it's assigned to the correct group
- Check that it's in at least "Ready to Submit" status
- Ensure product ID is correct

**Wrong upgrade/downgrade behavior:**
- Review level rankings (1 = highest)
- Verify subscription tiers make sense
- Check that levels are set correctly

**Products from different groups:**
- Users can subscribe to multiple groups simultaneously
- This is intentional - keep related products in same group

**getActiveProducts showing multiple subscriptions:**
- Check if subscriptions are in different groups
- Verify user isn't subscribed via Family Sharing
- Review subscription status in App Store Connect
