  </Card>
  <Card title="Request configuration" icon="setting">
    Fine-tune ad requests with child-directed flags, content ratings, and extra network parameters.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Lifecycle management" icon="refresh">
    Create, load, show, hide, and destroy ads on demand while tracking load state.
