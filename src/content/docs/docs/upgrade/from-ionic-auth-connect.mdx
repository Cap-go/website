Ionic Auth Connect handles enterprise OAuth and OIDC flows. Capgo's Social Login plugin provides provider-native sign-in for Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, and generic OAuth2 providers.

## Capgo replacements at a glance

| Ionic enterprise plugin | Capgo replacement | Migration guide |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Secure Storage | [@capgo/capacitor-fast-sql](/docs/plugins/fast-sql/) or [@capgo/capacitor-data-storage-sqlite](/docs/plugins/data-storage-sqlite/) | [Secure Storage migration](/docs/upgrade/from-ionic-secure-storage) |
| Auth Connect | [@capgo/capacitor-social-login](/docs/plugins/social-login/) | You are here |
| Identity Vault | [@capgo/capacitor-native-biometric](/docs/plugins/native-biometric/) | [Identity Vault migration](/docs/upgrade/from-ionic-identity-vault) |

## Migration steps

1. **Inventory your providers** (Google, Apple, Facebook, Azure AD, Auth0, Okta, etc.) and the redirect URLs you currently use.
2. **Install Social Login** and sync native code.

```bash
npm install @capgo/capacitor-social-login
npx cap sync
```

3. **Configure each provider** using the Social Login docs (client IDs, bundle IDs, OAuth redirect URIs).
4. **Update your auth flow** to call Social Login provider methods instead of Auth Connect. Store refresh tokens in a secure store (Fast SQL or Data Storage SQLite) if you rely on long-lived sessions.
5. **Remove Ionic Auth Connect** from your dependencies and native configuration.
