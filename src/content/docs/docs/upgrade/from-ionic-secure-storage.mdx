Ionic Secure Storage is an enterprise plugin for encrypted key-value data. Capgo provides two SQLite-based options depending on your data model and performance needs.

## Capgo replacements at a glance

| Ionic enterprise plugin | Capgo replacement | Migration guide |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Secure Storage | [@capgo/capacitor-fast-sql](/docs/plugins/fast-sql/) or [@capgo/capacitor-data-storage-sqlite](/docs/plugins/data-storage-sqlite/) | You are here |
| Auth Connect | [@capgo/capacitor-social-login](/docs/plugins/social-login/) | [Auth Connect migration](/docs/upgrade/from-ionic-auth-connect) |
| Identity Vault | [@capgo/capacitor-native-biometric](/docs/plugins/native-biometric/) | [Identity Vault migration](/docs/upgrade/from-ionic-identity-vault) |

## Choose your storage plugin

- **Fast SQL**: Best for large datasets, sync workflows, or when you want full SQL control and high throughput.
- **Data Storage SQLite**: Best for simple key-value storage with optional encryption and minimal setup.

If you are unsure, start with Data Storage SQLite for key-value secrets and move to Fast SQL when you need structured data or high-volume writes.

## Migration steps

1. **Pick the storage plugin** that matches your data model.
2. **Install the plugin** and sync native code.

```bash
# Option A: Fast SQL
npm install @capgo/capacitor-fast-sql

# Option B: Data Storage SQLite
npm install @capgo/capacitor-data-storage-sqlite

npx cap sync
```

3. **Update storage calls** to the new API surface. Use the Fast SQL or Data Storage SQLite docs for the exact read/write methods.
4. **Migrate existing data** on first launch by reading values from Ionic Secure Storage and writing them into the new SQLite store.
5. **Remove Ionic Secure Storage** from your dependencies and native configuration.
