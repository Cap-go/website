Ionic Identity Vault combines biometric gating with encrypted storage. Capgo replaces that stack with Native Biometric for user verification plus Fast SQL or Data Storage SQLite for encrypted persistence.

## Capgo replacements at a glance

| Ionic enterprise plugin | Capgo replacement | Migration guide |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Secure Storage | [@capgo/capacitor-fast-sql](/docs/plugins/fast-sql/) or [@capgo/capacitor-data-storage-sqlite](/docs/plugins/data-storage-sqlite/) | [Secure Storage migration](/docs/upgrade/from-ionic-secure-storage) |
| Auth Connect | [@capgo/capacitor-social-login](/docs/plugins/social-login/) | [Auth Connect migration](/docs/upgrade/from-ionic-auth-connect) |
| Identity Vault | [@capgo/capacitor-native-biometric](/docs/plugins/native-biometric/) | You are here |

## Migration steps

1. **Install Native Biometric** and sync native code.

```bash
npm install @capgo/capacitor-native-biometric
npx cap sync
```

2. **Pick a secure storage plugin** (Fast SQL or Data Storage SQLite) to persist tokens or secrets.
3. **Gate sensitive reads/writes** with a biometric prompt before accessing the stored data.
4. **Migrate stored secrets** on first launch by reading from Identity Vault and writing them into the new SQLite store.
5. **Remove Ionic Identity Vault** from your dependencies and native configuration.
