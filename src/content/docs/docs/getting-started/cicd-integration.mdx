Integrating Capgo into your CI/CD pipeline allows you to fully automate the process of building and deploying updates to your app. By leveraging the Capgo CLI and semantic-release, you can ensure consistent, reliable deployments and enable rapid iteration.

## Benefits of CI/CD Integration

- **Automation**: No more manual steps or room for human error. Your entire build, test, and deployment process can be automated from end to end.

- **Consistency**: Every deployment follows the same set of steps, ensuring a predictable and repeatable process. This is especially valuable when you have multiple team members contributing code.

- **Faster iterations**: With automated deployments, you can ship updates more frequently and with confidence. No more waiting for manual QA or release approvals.

## Capgo CLI

The Capgo CLI is the key to integrating Capgo into your CI/CD workflow. It provides commands for pushing new bundle versions, managing channels, and more.

The most important command for CI/CD integration is `bundle upload`:

```shell
npx @capgo/cli@latest bundle upload --channel Production --apikey YOUR_API_KEY
```

If you use encryption you shoud provide it from one of this way:
```shell
npx @capgo/cli@latest bundle upload --channel Production --apikey YOUR_API_KEY --key-v2 PRIVATE_KEY_PATH
```

Alternatively you can provide the key data that way:
```shell
npx @capgo/cli@latest bundle upload --channel Production --apikey YOUR_API_KEY --key-v2-data PRIVATE_KEY_CONTENT
```

This command uploads the current web build to the specified channel. You'll typically run this as the last step in your CI/CD pipeline, after your web build has completed successfully.

## Setting up Capgo in your CI/CD Pipeline

While the exact steps will vary depending on your CI/CD tool of choice, the general process for integrating Capgo looks like this:

<Steps>
1. **Generate an API key**: Log in to the Capgo dashboard and create a new API key. This key will be used to authenticate the CLI in your CI/CD environment. Keep it secret and never commit it to your repository!

3. **Configure the `bundle upload` command**: Add a step to your CI/CD configuration that runs the `bundle upload` command with the appropriate arguments: <Code lang="yaml" title="upload.yml" code={`- run: npx @capgo/cli@latest bundle upload --channel=Production --apikey=$\{\{ secrets.CAPGO_API_KEY \}\}`} />\n Replace `Production` with the channel you want to deploy to, and `${{ secrets.CAPGO_API_KEY }}` with the environment variable holding your API key.

4. **Add the `upload` step after your web build**: Ensure that the `upload` step comes after your web build has completed successfully. This ensures you're always deploying your latest code.\n  Here's an example configuration for GitHub Actions:\n<Code lang="yaml" title="upload.yml" code={`name: Deploy to Capgo\n on:\n  push:\n   branches: [main]\n\njobs:\n deploy:\n runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n steps:\n - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n - uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n  with:\n   node-version: 18\n\n - run: npm ci\n - run: npm run build\n\n - run: npm install -g @capgo/cli\n - run: npx @capgo/cli@latest bundle upload --channel=Production --apikey=$\{\{ secrets.CAPGO_API_KEY \}\}`} />

</Steps>

## Semantic-release Integration

Semantic-release is a powerful tool for automating version management and generating release notes. By integrating semantic-release with Capgo, you can automatically increment your app version and generate changelogs with each deployment.

Here's a sample `.releaserc` configuration file for semantic-release:

```json
{
  "branches": [
    "main",
    {
      "name": "beta",
      "prerelease": true
    }
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    "@semantic-release/changelog",
    [
      "@semantic-release/exec",
      {
        "publishCmd": "npx @capgo/cli@latest bundle upload --channel=${nextRelease.channel} --apikey YOUR_API_KEY --partial"
      }
    ],
    [
      "@semantic-release/git",
      {
        "assets": ["CHANGELOG.md", "package.json"],
        "message": "chore(release): ${nextRelease.version} [skip ci]\n\n${nextRelease.notes}"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

This configuration does the following:

1. Analyzes commit messages to determine the next version number, following the Conventional Commits spec.
2. Generates release notes based on the commits since the last release.
3. Updates the `CHANGELOG.md` file with the new release notes.
4. Runs the Capgo CLI `bundle upload` command, passing the new version number and using the `--partial` flag for differential updates.
5. Commits the updated `CHANGELOG.md`, `package.json`, and any other changed files back to the repository.

To use semantic-release with Capgo, simply add a step to your CI/CD configuration that runs `npx semantic-release`. Ensure this step comes after your web build and before the Capgo `bundle upload` step.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your Capgo CI/CD integration, here are a few things to check:

- **API key**: Ensure your API key is valid and has the necessary permissions. If using an environment variable, double check that it's set correctly.

- **CLI version**: Make sure you're using the latest version of the Capgo CLI. Older versions may have compatibility issues or lack certain features.

- **Build artifacts**: Confirm that your web build is generating the expected output files. The Capgo CLI needs a valid web build to create a bundle.

- **Network connectivity**: Check that your CI/CD environment has network access to the Capgo servers. Firewall or proxy issues can sometimes interfere with the `upload` command.

If you're still having trouble, reach out to Capgo support for assistance. They can help troubleshoot any issues with your specific setup.

## Conclusion

Integrating Capgo into your CI/CD pipeline and leveraging semantic-release for version management can greatly streamline your development workflow. By automating your deployments and versioning, you can ship updates faster and with more confidence.

The Capgo CLI and semantic-release provide a powerful combination for achieving fully automated, end-to-end releases. With a bit of configuration, you can have a robust and reliable deployment process that allows you to focus on building great features rather than worrying about manual release steps.
