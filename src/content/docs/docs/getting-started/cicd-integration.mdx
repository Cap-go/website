Integrating Capgo into your CI/CD pipeline allows you to fully automate the process of building and deploying updates to your app. By leveraging the Capgo CLI and semantic-release, you can ensure consistent, reliable deployments and enable rapid iteration.

## Benefits of CI/CD Integration

- **Automation**: No more manual steps or room for human error. Your entire build, test, and deployment process can be automated from end to end.

- **Consistency**: Every deployment follows the same set of steps, ensuring a predictable and repeatable process. This is especially valuable when you have multiple team members contributing code.

- **Faster iterations**: With automated deployments, you can ship updates more frequently and with confidence. No more waiting for manual QA or release approvals.

## Capgo CLI

The Capgo CLI is the key to integrating Capgo into your CI/CD workflow. It provides commands for pushing new bundle versions, managing channels, and more.

The most important command for CI/CD integration is `bundle upload`:

```shell
npx @capgo/cli@latest bundle upload --channel Production --apikey YOUR_API_KEY
```

If you use encryption you should provide it from one of these ways:

**Using a private key file path:**
```shell
npx @capgo/cli@latest bundle upload --channel Production --apikey YOUR_API_KEY --key-v2 PRIVATE_KEY_PATH
```

**Using the private key content directly (recommended for CI/CD):**
```shell
npx @capgo/cli@latest bundle upload --channel Production --apikey YOUR_API_KEY --key-data-v2 PRIVATE_KEY_CONTENT
```

**Using environment variables (best practice for CI/CD):**
```shell
npx @capgo/cli@latest bundle upload --channel Production --apikey YOUR_API_KEY --key-data-v2 "$CAPGO_PRIVATE_KEY"
```

### Setting up Environment Variables for Encryption

For CI/CD environments, it's recommended to store your private key as an environment variable rather than a file. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Get your private key content:**
   ```shell
   cat .capgo_key_v2 | pbcopy
   ```
   This copies the key content to your clipboard.

2. **Add it to your CI/CD environment:**
   - **GitHub Actions**: Add `CAPGO_PRIVATE_KEY` to your repository secrets
   - **GitLab CI**: Add it as a masked variable in your project settings
   - **CircleCI**: Add it as an environment variable in your project settings
   - **Jenkins**: Add it as a secret text credential

3. **Use it in your pipeline:**
   ```yaml
   - run: npx @capgo/cli@latest bundle upload --channel=Production --apikey=${{ secrets.CAPGO_API_KEY }} --key-data-v2 "${{ secrets.CAPGO_PRIVATE_KEY }}"
   ```

**Note**: The `--key-data-v2` flag allows you to pass the private key content directly as a string, making it perfect for environment variables in CI/CD pipelines where you don't want to create temporary files.

This command uploads the current web build to the specified channel. You'll typically run this as the last step in your CI/CD pipeline, after your web build has completed successfully.

## Setting up Capgo in your CI/CD Pipeline

While the exact steps will vary depending on your CI/CD tool of choice, the general process for integrating Capgo looks like this:

<Steps>
1. **Generate an API key**: Log in to the Capgo dashboard and create a new API key. This key will be used to authenticate the CLI in your CI/CD environment. Keep it secret and never commit it to your repository!

3. **Configure the `bundle upload` command**: Add a step to your CI/CD configuration that runs the `bundle upload` command with the appropriate arguments: <Code lang="yaml" title="upload.yml" code={`- run: npx @capgo/cli@latest bundle upload --channel=Production --apikey=$\{\{ secrets.CAPGO_API_KEY \}\}`} />\n Replace `Production` with the channel you want to deploy to, `${{ secrets.CAPGO_API_KEY }}` with the environment variable holding your API key, and add `--key-data-v2 "${{ secrets.CAPGO_PRIVATE_KEY }}"` if using encryption.

4. **Add the `upload` step after your web build**: Ensure that the `upload` step comes after your web build has completed successfully. This ensures you're always deploying your latest code.\n  Here's an example configuration for GitHub Actions:\n<Code lang="yaml" title="upload.yml" code={`name: Deploy to Capgo\n on:\n  push:\n   branches: [main]\n\njobs:\n deploy:\n runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n steps:\n - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n - uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n  with:\n   node-version: 18\n\n - run: npm ci\n - run: npm run build\n\n - run: npm install -g @capgo/cli\n - run: npx @capgo/cli@latest bundle upload --channel=Production --apikey=$\{\{ secrets.CAPGO_API_KEY \}\} --key-data-v2 "$\{\{ secrets.CAPGO_PRIVATE_KEY \}\}"`} />

</Steps>

## Version Management with Semantic-release

The recommended way to handle versioning with Capgo is to set the version in your `capacitor.config.ts` file by importing it from `package.json`:

```ts
import pkg from './package.json'

const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  // ... other config
  plugins: {
    CapacitorUpdater: {
      version: pkg.version,
    }
  }
}
```

This approach allows you to:
1. Use semantic-release (or any other tool) to update the `package.json` version
2. Build your app with the updated version automatically included
3. Upload the bundle with the correct version

Your CI/CD workflow would look like this:
```yaml
- run: npm ci
- run: npx semantic-release  # Updates package.json version
- run: npm run build         # Builds with new version from capacitor.config
- run: npx @capgo/cli@latest bundle upload --channel=Production --apikey=${{ secrets.CAPGO_API_KEY }}
```

Here's a sample `.releaserc` configuration file for semantic-release:

```json
{
  "branches": [
    "main",
    {
      "name": "beta",
      "prerelease": true
    }
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    "@semantic-release/changelog",
    [
      "@semantic-release/git",
      {
        "assets": ["CHANGELOG.md", "package.json"],
        "message": "chore(release): ${nextRelease.version} [skip ci]\n\n${nextRelease.notes}"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

This configuration does the following:

1. Analyzes commit messages to determine the next version number, following the Conventional Commits spec.
2. Generates release notes based on the commits since the last release.
3. Updates the `CHANGELOG.md` file with the new release notes.
4. Updates the `package.json` version, which will be picked up by your capacitor.config.
5. Commits the updated `CHANGELOG.md`, `package.json`, and any other changed files back to the repository.

Make sure to run semantic-release before building your app so that the updated version from `package.json` is included in your build through the capacitor.config.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your Capgo CI/CD integration, here are a few things to check:

- **API key**: Ensure your API key is valid and has the necessary permissions. If using an environment variable, double check that it's set correctly.

- **CLI version**: Make sure you're using the latest version of the Capgo CLI. Older versions may have compatibility issues or lack certain features.

- **Build artifacts**: Confirm that your web build is generating the expected output files. The Capgo CLI needs a valid web build to create a bundle.

- **Network connectivity**: Check that your CI/CD environment has network access to the Capgo servers. Firewall or proxy issues can sometimes interfere with the `upload` command.

If you're still having trouble, reach out to Capgo support for assistance. They can help troubleshoot any issues with your specific setup.

## Conclusion

Integrating Capgo into your CI/CD pipeline with proper version management can greatly streamline your development workflow. By automating your deployments and versioning through the capacitor.config approach, you can ship updates faster and with more confidence.

The recommended approach of setting the version in your `capacitor.config.ts` file and using semantic-release to update `package.json` provides a robust and reliable deployment process that allows you to focus on building great features rather than worrying about manual release steps.
