</Steps>

### Manual setup

In case the init command doesn't work for you, you can manually add an app.

<Steps>

1. Connect the CLI to your account: <Code code={`npx @capgo/cli@latest login [APIKEY]`} lang="bash" />

2. Add the app to your account with this command: <Code code={`npx @capgo/cli@latest app add [APP_NAME]`} lang="bash" />

3. Install the plugin in your app: <Code code={`npm i @capgo/capacitor-updater`} lang="bash" />

4. Call the init method as early as possible in your app: <Code code={`import { CapacitorUpdater } from '@capgo/capacitor-updater';\nCapacitorUpdater.notifyAppReady();`} lang="typescript" />

5. Deploy a live update <LinkCard href="/docs/getting-started/deploy/" title="Deploy a live update" description="Learn how to deploy a live update to your app" />
