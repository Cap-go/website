Use Capgo's Live Updates feature to update the UI and business logic of your app remotely, in real-time. Push JS bundle updates directly to your users without going through the app store to instantly fix bugs and ship new features.

This guide assumes you've completed the [Capgo Quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quickstart) and have already:

<Steps>

1. Installed the `@capgo/capacitor-updater` SDK in your Capacitor app 

2. Configured your app ID and update channel in `capacitor.config.ts`

3. Added in your code the `CapacitorUpdater.notifyAppReady()` method

</Steps>

If you haven't done those steps yet, please go back and complete the quickstart first.

## Uploading a Bundle

With the Capgo SDK installed and configured, you're ready to upload your first live update bundle:

1. Build your web assets:
   ```shell
   npm run build
   ```

2. Upload the bundle to Capgo:
    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="Console">
        ```shell
      npx @capgo/cli@latest bundle upload --channel=Production
      ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Github Actions">
      ```yml
      // .github/workflows/build_and_deploy.yml
    name: Build source code and send to Capgo

    concurrency:
      group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
      cancel-in-progress: true

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main

    jobs:
      deploy_to_capgo:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout
            uses: actions/checkout@v4
          - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
            with:
              node-version: 18
          - name: Install dependencies
            run: npm install
          - name: Build
            run: npm run build
          - name: Deploy to Capgo
            run: bunx @capgo/cli@latest bundle upload -a ${{ secrets.CAPGO_TOKEN }} --channel ${{ env.CHANNEL }}
            env:
              CAPGO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CAPGO_TOKEN }}
      ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Gitlab">
      ```yml
      // .gitlab-ci.yml
      stages:
        - build

      build:
        stage: build
        image: node:18
        cache:
          - key:
              files:
                - package-lock.json
            paths:
              - .node_modules/
        script:
          - npm install
          - npm run build
          - npx @capgo/cli@latest bundle upload -a $CAPGO_TOKEN --channel $CAPGO_CHANNEL
        artifacts:
          paths:
            - node_modules/
            - dist/
        only:
          - master
      ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
   This will upload a new bundle version to the channel specified in the command.

### Troubleshooting Uploads

If your upload fails, double check:
- Your app ID in `capacitor.config.ts` matches your app in the Capgo dashboard
- You're running the upload command from the root of your Capacitor project
- Your web assets are built and up to date

If you're still having trouble, go to the [Troubleshooting](/docs/getting-started/troubleshooting/) section.

## Receiving an Update on a Device

Once your bundle is uploaded, you can test the live update on a device:

1. Sync your app to the device:
   ```shell
   npx cap sync ios
   ```

2. Open another terminal and run the following command to check the update status:
   ```shell
   npx @capgo/cli@latest app debug
   ```

3. Run your app locally:
   ```shell
   npx cap run ios
   ``` 
   Or open the iOS/Android project in Xcode/Android Studio and do a native run.

4. Keep the app open for about 30 seconds to allow the update to download in the background. 

5. The logs will take a few seconds to update and show the update status.

6. Close and reopen the app. You should see your live update applied!

Refer back to the [Capgo Quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quickstart#receiving-a-live-update-on-a-device) for more details on testing live updates.
