Get started with Capgo Cloud Build and create your first iOS or Android native build in minutes.

## What You'll Need

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A Capacitor app that builds successfully locally
- Node.js 20 or higher installed
- A Capgo account with an active subscription
- Your app already registered in Capgo (run `npx @capgo/cli@latest app add` if not)
- **Build credentials configured** (certificates, keystores) - see below

## Before Your First Build

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="⚠️ Setup Credentials First" icon="warning">
    **Required before building:** You must configure your build credentials (certificates for iOS, keystores for Android).

    [Setup Credentials →](/docs/cli/cloud-build/credentials/)
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Start

<Steps>

1. **Setup Build Credentials**

   Before you can build, you need to save your credentials locally:

   **For iOS:**
   ```bash
   npx @capgo/cli build credentials save \
     --platform ios \
     --certificate ./cert.p12 \
     --p12-password "password" \
     --provisioning-profile ./profile.mobileprovision \
     --apple-key ./AuthKey.p8 \
     --apple-key-id "KEY123" \
     --apple-issuer-id "issuer-uuid" \
     --apple-team-id "team-id"
   ```

   **For Android:**
   ```bash
   npx @capgo/cli build credentials save \
     --platform android \
     --keystore ./release.keystore \
     --keystore-alias "my-key" \
     --keystore-key-password "key-pass" \
     --keystore-store-password "store-pass"
   ```

   See the [full credentials guide](/docs/cli/cloud-build/credentials/) for details.

2. **Verify Local Build**

   First, ensure your app builds locally without errors:

   ```bash
   # Build your web assets
   npm run build

   # Sync with Capacitor
   npx cap sync

   # Test local build (optional but recommended)
   npx cap open ios    # For iOS
   npx cap open android # For Android
   ```

3. **Authenticate with Capgo**

   Set your Capgo API key (if not already configured):

   ```bash
   npx @capgo/cli@latest login
   ```

   Or set the environment variable:
   ```bash
   export CAPGO_TOKEN=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run Your First Build**

   Start with an Android debug build (fastest to test):

   ```bash
   npx @capgo/cli@latest build com.example.app \
     --platform android \
     --build-mode debug
   ```

   You'll see real-time logs as your build progresses:
   ```
   ✔ Creating build job...
   ✔ Uploading project (15.2 MB)...
   ✔ Build started

   📝 Build logs:
   → Installing dependencies...
   → Running Gradle build...
   → Signing APK...
   ✔ Build succeeded in 3m 42s
   ```

5. **Check Build Status**

   The CLI will automatically poll and display the build status. Once complete, you'll see:

   - Build time
   - Success/failure status
   - App submitted to App Store/Play Store (if credentials configured)

</Steps>

## Understanding the Build Process

When you run the build command, here's what happens:

<MermaidGraph graph={buildProcessFlowGraph} ariaLabel="Capgo Cloud Build process flow diagram" />

1. **Local Preparation** - Your project is zipped (excluding `node_modules` and dotfiles)
2. **Upload** - The zip is uploaded to secure cloud storage (Cloudflare R2)
3. **Build Execution** - Your app builds on dedicated infrastructure
4. **Log Streaming** - Real-time logs stream to your terminal via Server-Sent Events
5. **Automatic Cleanup** - Build artifacts are deleted (Android: instant, iOS: 24 hours)

## Your First Production Build

Once you've verified the process works, create a production build:

### Android

```bash
npx @capgo/cli@latest build com.example.app \
  --platform android \
  --build-mode release
```

You'll need to configure signing credentials first. See [Android Build Configuration](/docs/cli/cloud-build/android/).

### iOS

```bash
npx @capgo/cli@latest build com.example.app \
  --platform ios \
  --build-mode release
```

iOS builds require signing certificates and provisioning profiles. See [iOS Build Configuration](/docs/cli/cloud-build/ios/).

## What Gets Built

Capgo Build only uploads the **minimum files needed** to compile your native app. Your full source code never leaves your machine.

### What Gets Uploaded

| Included | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ios/` or `android/` | The native platform folder you're building |
| `package.json`, `package-lock.json` | Dependency manifest |
| `capacitor.config.*` | Capacitor configuration |
| `resources/` | App icons, splash screens |
| Native plugin code | Only the `ios/` or `android/` subfolder of each Capacitor plugin |

### What's NOT Uploaded

| Excluded | Why |
|----------|-----|
| `node_modules/` (most of it) | Only native plugin code is included, not JS dependencies |
| `src/` | Your web source code stays local |
| `dist/`, `www/`, `build/` (root level) | Already synced into the native folder via `cap sync` |
| `.git/` | Version control history |
| `.gradle/`, `.idea/`, `.swiftpm/` | Build caches and IDE settings |
| `.env`, secrets | Never uploaded |

<Aside>
Your built web assets (JS, CSS, HTML) **are** uploaded - but as part of the native folder. When you run `npx cap sync`, your web build is copied into `ios/App/App/public/` or `android/app/src/main/assets/public/`. That's why running `cap sync` before building is required.
</Aside>

### Your Responsibilities

Before running `npx @capgo/cli build`:

1. **Build your web assets** - Run `npm run build` (or your framework's build command)
2. **Sync to native** - Run `npx cap sync` to copy web assets into the native project
3. **Commit dependencies** - Ensure all native plugins are in `package.json`

### What Capgo Build Handles

- Native iOS compilation (Xcode, Fastlane)
- Native Android compilation (Gradle)
- Code signing with your credentials
- App store submission (if configured)

<div style="border-top: 1px solid var(--sl-color-gray-5); margin: 2rem 0;"></div>

## Build Time & Costs

Build time is measured from start to completion:

- **Android**: Typically 3-5 minutes (1× billing multiplier)
- **iOS**: Typically 5-10 minutes (2× billing multiplier due to Mac hardware costs)

You only pay for actual build time used. No hidden fees.

## Common Use Cases

### CI/CD Integration

Add to your GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- name: Build native app
  env:
    CAPGO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CAPGO_TOKEN }}
  run: |
    npm run build
    npx cap sync
    npx @capgo/cli@latest build ${{ secrets.APP_ID }} \
      --platform both \
      --build-mode release
```

### Local Development

Test builds locally before committing:

```bash
# Quick debug build for testing
npm run build && npx cap sync
npx @capgo/cli@latest build com.example.app \
  --platform android \
  --build-mode debug
```

### Multi-Platform Builds

Build for both platforms by running two commands:

```bash
# iOS build
npx @capgo/cli@latest build com.example.app \
  --platform ios \
  --build-mode release

# Android build
npx @capgo/cli@latest build com.example.app \
  --platform android \
  --build-mode release
```

In CI/CD, you can run these in parallel jobs for faster builds.
