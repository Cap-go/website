Get started with Capgo Cloud Build and create your first iOS or Android native build in minutes.

## What You'll Need

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A Capacitor app that builds successfully locally
- Node.js 20 or higher installed
- A Capgo account with an active subscription
- Your app already registered in Capgo (run `npx @capgo/cli@latest app add` if not)
- **Build credentials configured** (certificates, keystores) - see below

## Before Your First Build

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="⚠️ Setup Credentials First" icon="warning">
    **Required before building:** You must configure your build credentials (certificates for iOS, keystores for Android).

    [Setup Credentials →](/docs/cli/cloud-build/credentials/)
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Start

<Steps>

1. **Setup Build Credentials**

   Before you can build, you need to save your credentials locally:

   **For iOS:**
   ```bash
   npx @capgo/cli build credentials save \
     --platform ios \
     --certificate ./cert.p12 \
     --p12-password "password" \
     --provisioning-profile ./profile.mobileprovision \
     --apple-key ./AuthKey.p8 \
     --apple-key-id "KEY123" \
     --apple-issuer-id "issuer-uuid" \
     --apple-team-id "team-id"
   ```

   **For Android:**
   ```bash
   npx @capgo/cli build credentials save \
     --platform android \
     --keystore ./release.keystore \
     --keystore-alias "my-key" \
     --keystore-key-password "key-pass" \
     --keystore-store-password "store-pass"
   ```

   See the [full credentials guide](/docs/cli/cloud-build/credentials/) for details.

2. **Verify Local Build**

   First, ensure your app builds locally without errors:

   ```bash
   # Build your web assets
   npm run build

   # Sync with Capacitor
   npx cap sync

   # Test local build (optional but recommended)
   npx cap open ios    # For iOS
   npx cap open android # For Android
   ```

3. **Authenticate with Capgo**

   Set your Capgo API key (if not already configured):

   ```bash
   npx @capgo/cli@latest login
   ```

   Or set the environment variable:
   ```bash
   export CAPGO_TOKEN=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run Your First Build**

   Start with an Android debug build (fastest to test):

   ```bash
   npx @capgo/cli@latest build com.example.app \
     --platform android \
     --build-mode debug
   ```

   You'll see real-time logs as your build progresses:
   ```
   ✔ Creating build job...
   ✔ Uploading project (15.2 MB)...
   ✔ Build started

   📝 Build logs:
   → Installing dependencies...
   → Running Gradle build...
   → Signing APK...
   ✔ Build succeeded in 3m 42s
   ```

5. **Check Build Status**

   The CLI will automatically poll and display the build status. Once complete, you'll see:

   - Build time
   - Success/failure status
   - App submitted to App Store/Play Store (if credentials configured)

</Steps>

## Understanding the Build Process

When you run the build command, here's what happens:

<MermaidGraph graph={buildProcessFlowGraph} ariaLabel="Capgo Cloud Build process flow diagram" />

1. **Local Preparation** - Your project is zipped (excluding `node_modules` and dotfiles)
2. **Upload** - The zip is uploaded to secure cloud storage (Cloudflare R2)
3. **Build Execution** - Your app builds on dedicated infrastructure
4. **Log Streaming** - Real-time logs stream to your terminal via Server-Sent Events
5. **Automatic Cleanup** - Build artifacts are deleted (Android: instant, iOS: 24 hours)

## Your First Production Build

Once you've verified the process works, create a production build:

### Android

```bash
npx @capgo/cli@latest build com.example.app \
  --platform android \
  --build-mode release
```

You'll need to configure signing credentials first. See [Android Build Configuration](/docs/cli/cloud-build/android/).

### iOS

```bash
npx @capgo/cli@latest build com.example.app \
  --platform ios \
  --build-mode release
```

iOS builds require signing certificates and provisioning profiles. See [iOS Build Configuration](/docs/cli/cloud-build/ios/).

## What Gets Built

**Important:** Capgo Cloud Build only builds the **native parts** of your app (iOS and Android native code).

You are responsible for:
- Building your web assets (`npm run build`)
- Running `npx cap sync` before the build
- Ensuring all dependencies are in `package.json`

We handle:
- Native iOS compilation (Xcode, Fastlane)
- Native Android compilation (Gradle)
- Code signing
- App store submission (if configured)

## Build Time & Costs

Build time is measured from start to completion:

- **Android**: Typically 3-5 minutes (1× billing multiplier)
- **iOS**: Typically 5-10 minutes (2× billing multiplier due to Mac hardware costs)

You only pay for actual build time used. No hidden fees.

## Common Use Cases

### CI/CD Integration

Add to your GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- name: Build native app
  env:
    CAPGO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CAPGO_TOKEN }}
  run: |
    npm run build
    npx cap sync
    npx @capgo/cli@latest build ${{ secrets.APP_ID }} \
      --platform both \
      --build-mode release
```

### Local Development

Test builds locally before committing:

```bash
# Quick debug build for testing
npm run build && npx cap sync
npx @capgo/cli@latest build com.example.app \
  --platform android \
  --build-mode debug
```

### Multi-Platform Builds

Build for both platforms simultaneously:

```bash
npx @capgo/cli@latest build com.example.app \
  --platform both \
  --build-mode release
```
