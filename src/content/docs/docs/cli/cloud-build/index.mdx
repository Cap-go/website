Capgo Build is a cloud-based native app compilation service for Capacitor apps. It lets you build iOS and Android apps without maintaining local development environments - no Xcode, no Android Studio, no Mac hardware required.

## What Capgo Build Does

Capgo Build compiles the **native parts** of your Capacitor app in the cloud:

- **iOS builds** run on dedicated Apple Silicon (Mac Mini M4) machines
- **Android builds** run in isolated Docker containers
- **Automatic code signing** handles certificates, provisioning profiles, and keystores
- **Direct store submission** uploads signed apps to App Store Connect and Google Play

You trigger builds with a single CLI command that works from anywhere - your local machine, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or any CI/CD pipeline.

## When to Use Capgo Build vs Live Updates

Capgo offers two complementary features for updating your app. Here's when to use each:

| Scenario | Live Updates | Capgo Build |
|----------|:------------:|:-----------:|
| Bug fix in JavaScript/TypeScript code | ✓ | |
| UI changes (HTML, CSS, images) | ✓ | |
| Updating web dependencies | ✓ | |
| Adding or removing a Capacitor plugin | | ✓ |
| Updating a native SDK version | | ✓ |
| Changing native permissions (Info.plist, AndroidManifest) | | ✓ |
| Updating Capacitor version | | ✓ |
| Modifying native code (Swift, Kotlin, Java) | | ✓ |
| Changing app icon or splash screen | | ✓ |
| First app store submission | | ✓ |

<Aside>
**Live Updates** push JavaScript changes instantly without app store review. **Capgo Build** creates new native binaries when you change native code. Most teams use Live Updates daily and Capgo Build occasionally when native changes are needed.

    Build and ship iOS apps without Mac hardware. Anyone on Windows, Linux, or any CI/CD system can trigger iOS builds and publish to TestFlight.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Skip Local Environment Setup" icon="rocket">
    No need to install Xcode, Android Studio, or manage SDK versions. Capgo Build handles all native tooling - you just run the CLI command.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Centralized Credentials" icon="setting">
    Store your certificates and keystores in your CI/CD secrets once. Any team member can trigger builds without needing signing credentials on their local machine.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Works With Any CI/CD" icon="github">
    A single CLI command integrates with any pipeline. GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins - trigger builds as part of your existing workflow.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Real-Time Build Logs" icon="list-format">
    Watch your build progress live in your terminal. Logs stream via Server-Sent Events so you can debug issues instantly as they happen.

  <Card title="Direct Store Submission" icon="approve-check">
    Signed apps upload directly to App Store Connect and Google Play. No manual steps between build completion and store submission.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## How It Works

When you run the build command:

1. **Upload** - The CLI zips only what's needed (native platform folder + native dependencies) and uploads to secure cloud storage
2. **Build** - Your app compiles on dedicated infrastructure using Fastlane
3. **Sign** - Certificates and keystores are applied (they exist only in memory during the build)
4. **Submit** - Signed apps are uploaded directly to App Store Connect or Google Play
5. **Cleanup** - All build artifacts and credentials are automatically deleted

Your source code stays on your machine. Only the platform-specific native code is uploaded.

## Security Model

Capgo Build is designed with zero credential storage:

- **Runtime-only credentials** - Certificates and keystores exist only in memory during the build, never written to disk
- **Ephemeral environments** - Each build runs in isolation and is destroyed after completion
- **No log storage** - Build logs stream to your terminal only, never stored on Capgo servers
- **Minimal upload** - Only the native platform you request is uploaded, not your full codebase

## Pricing

Build time is the only cost:

- Build minutes are included in your Capgo plan
- Extra minutes available via credit system
- iOS builds run on Mac Mini M4 (2x cost multiplier due to hardware costs)
- Android builds run in Docker containers (1x cost)
- No storage fees
