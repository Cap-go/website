Build and submit iOS apps to TestFlight and the App Store using Capgo's dedicated Mac infrastructure.

## What you will learn

 - You will learn how to upload your app via Capgo Native build
 - You will learn how to configure the certificates for Capgo Native Build

## Prerequisites

 - A Capgo account with an active subscription
 - Your app already registered in Capgo (run `npx @capgo/cli@latest app add` if not)
 - A Mac computer with Xcode installed (it's possible to setup the build on a linux/windows machine, but it's yet documented)
 - Valid Apple Developer account ($99/year) (You must have admin or owner rights on the Applle Developer account)
 - Your app must be able to build successfully via Xcode
 - A Capacitor app
 - A configured icon for the app. Apps without an icon cannot be uploaded to the App Store.
 
 :::note
 I will use the following app for the tutorial: https://github.com/Cap-go/capgo-native-build-tutorial-app
 :::


## The first manual build

Before we can start thinking about building the app with Capgo, we should first set it up, and do a first testflight build by hand.
There are some advantages to doing a manual build first:

- You will setup the distribution certificate on your local machine
- You will create the appstore record if you haven't done it yet
- You will be able to figure out any issues with the build process linked to your app code

Before we can begin, you must have the deployment certificate installed on your local machine.
This is quite a bit complex, but I will explain it bellow.

### Setting up the deployment certificate

<Steps>
1. Open Xcode
2. Click on `XCode` -> `Settings`
    Alternatively, you can use the shortcut `Cmd + ,`

    ![Xcode settings](/native-build-assets/xcode-settings.webp)
3. Go to `Apple Accounts`
    ![Xcode apple accounts](/native-build-assets/xcode-apple-accounts.webp)
4. Find the Apple Account that is added to the Apple Developer Account
    ![Xcode selected apple account](/native-build-assets/xcode-selected-account.webp)
5. Find the team that you will use to deploy the app
    ![Xcode find team](/native-build-assets/xcode-find-team.webp)
6. Click on the `Manage Certificates` button
    ![Xcode manage certificates](/native-build-assets/xcode-manage-certificates.webp)
7. Make sure you can see the deployment certificate in the list
    ![Xcode deployment certificate](/native-build-assets/xcode-deployment-certificate.webp)
8. If you do not, you need to create a new certificate

    :::note
      Apple limits the numbers of deployment certificates you can have to 3. If you have more than 3 certificates, you need to delete one in order to create a new one. I will not convert that in the tutorial.
    :::

    1. Click on the `+` button and then on `Apple distribution`
        ![Xcode add certificate](/native-build-assets/xcode-add-certificate.webp)
    2. The certificate will be created automatically. You can see it in the list. Look at the previous step to confirm that you see it.
</Steps>

Now that you have the deployment certificate installed, you can begin the build process.

### Manual build to Testflight

<Steps>
  1. Open the app in Xcode

      Run `npx cap open ios` to open the app in Xcode.

  2. Find and click on the `archive` button

      In the Xcode toolbar, find and click on the `product` -> `archive` button.

      ![Xcode toolbar](/native-build-assets/xcode-toolbar.webp)
  3. Wait for the build to complete
  4. Click on the `Distribute App` button

      ![Xcode distribute button](/native-build-assets/xcode-distribue-app.webp)
  5. Select `TestFlight Internal Only` as the distribution method and click on `Distribute` button

      ![Xcode TestFlight internal only distribution method](/native-build-assets/xcode-distribue-testflight-1.webp)
  6. Configure the app record

      Fill in the following fields:
        1. Name: The name of your app - visible in the App Store
        2. SKU - the SKU of your app - this is used to identify your app in the App Store
        3. The primary language - the primary language of your app

      Then, click on the `next` button

      ![Xcode TestFlight configure app record](/native-build-assets/xcode-configure-app-record-testflight.webp)

    7. If the creation of the app record fails, try to close the window and try to archive the app again.

    8. Wait for the upload to complete

    9. If everything went well, you should see the following screen
      ![Xcode TestFlight upload complete](/native-build-assets/xcode-upload-complete-testflight.webp)
    10. Click on the `Done` button
</Steps>  


You may instinctively think that all is good now and that you will be able to see your app in Testflight now, but there are a few more things needed to be done before you can see your app in Testflight:

  1. You need to add yourself to TestFlight
  2. You need to promise Apple that your app doesn't use any non-standard (like a custom algorithm) encryption. If you app does use any non-standard encryption, I suggest reading the [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/overview-of-export-compliance) on how to handle this.

Let's start with the first one:

### Adding yourself to TestFlight

<Steps>
  1. Go to the [Appstore Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/) page
    ![Appstore Connect login page](/native-build-assets/appstore-connect-login.webp)
  2. Sign in with your Apple Developer account
  3. Select the team that you used when you created the app record. If you are only in one developer account, can skip this step.
    ![Appstore Connect team selection](/native-build-assets/appstore-connect-select-team.webp)
  4. Click on the `Apps` button
    ![Appstore Connect apps button](/native-build-assets/appstore-connect-apps-button.webp)
  5. Find the app you created in the previous step and click on it
    ![Appstore Connect app selection](/native-build-assets/appstore-connect-select-app.webp)
  6. Click on the `TestFlight` button
    ![Appstore Connect testflight button](/native-build-assets/appstore-connect-testflight-button.webp)
  7. Click on the `Internal Testers plus` button
    ![Appstore Connect internal testers plus button](/native-build-assets/appstore-connect-testflight-internal-testing-plus.webp)
  8. Create a new group

      I like to name the group "internal". You can name it whatever you want.

      ![Appstore Connect create new group](/native-build-assets/appstore-connect-testflight-internal-create-group.webp)
  9. Click on `Invite testers` button
    ![Appstore Connect invite testers button](/native-build-assets/appstore-connect-testflight-internal-invite-testers.webp)
  10. Add yourself to the group

      Find yourself in the list and select the checkbox next to your name. (You may need to refresh the page to see yourself)
      Then, click on the `Add` button.

      ![Appstore Connect invite tester checkbox](/native-build-assets/appstore-connect-testflight-internal-invite-tester-checkbox.webp)
  11. Verify that you are added to the group

      Now, you should see yourself in the group.

      ![Appstore Connect verify tester](/native-build-assets/appstore-connect-testflight-internal-verify-tester.webp)
</Steps>

Congratilations 🎉
You have added yourself to testflight. Now, there is just one more thing 
you need to do before you can configure Capgo Native Build.

### Setting up the compliance information

You now need to promise Apple that your app doesn't use any non-standard (like a custom algorithm) encryption. If you app does use any non-standard encryption, I suggest reading the [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/overview-of-export-compliance) on how to handle this.
There are two ways to do this:

1. You can do this by hand every time you build your app.
2. You can configure your plist file to automatically set this value to `false`.

Let's start with the first one:

<Steps>
  1. Follow all the steps from the previous section to find the TestFlight seciton in AppStore Connect
  2. Click on `Builds -> iOS`
    ![Appstore Connect builds iOS button](/native-build-assets/appstore-connect-builds-ios-button.webp)
  3. Find the build with missing compliance information and click on `Manage`
    ![Appstore Connect manage build](/native-build-assets/appstore-connect-manage-build.webp)
  4. Select the option that best describes your app

      For me, this is `none`, but it might be different for you.
      After, click save

      ![Appstore Connect save compliance information](/native-build-assets/appstore-connect-manage-build-compliance.webp)
  5. Your app should now say `ready to test`

      ![Appstore Connect ready to test](/native-build-assets/appstore-connect-ready-to-test.webp)
</Steps>

As for the second one, here are the steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open the `Info.plist` file
  2. Add the following key:

      ```xml
      <key>ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption</key>
      <false/>
      ```

  3. Save the file
</Steps>

:::note
[Here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/complying-with-encryption-export-regulations) is the official Apple documentation on how to inform Apple of your compliance with encryption export regulations.
