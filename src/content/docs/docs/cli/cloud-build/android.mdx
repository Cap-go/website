Build and submit Android apps to Google Play Store using Capgo's dedicated infrastructure.

## What you will learn

 - You will learn how to upload your app via Capgo Native build
 - You will learn how to configure the credentials for Capgo Native Build

## Prerequisites

  - You need to have an active Google Developer account
  - You need to have Android Studio installed
  - Your app must be able to build successfully with Android Studio]

:::note
 I will use the following app for the tutorial: https://github.com/Cap-go/capgo-native-build-tutorial-app
:::

## The first manual build

Before we can start thinking about building the app with Capgo, we should first set it up, and do a first Android build by hand.
There are some advantages to doing a manual build first:

 - You will prepare the credentials for the later Capgo build
 - You will create a record on the Play Store Console

### Building the app manually with Android Studio

Before we can start building the app with Capgo, we need to build the app manually with Android Studio.

<Steps>
  1. Open Android Studio

      Run `npx cap open android` to open the Android Studio project.

  2. Cick on `Build` -> `Generate Signed App Bundles / APKs`

  3. Select `Android App Bundle` and click on `Next`
    ![Android Studio select Android App Bundle](/native-build-assets/android-studio-select-android-app-bundle.webp)
  4. Generate the keystore file

      Right now, you are missing the keystore file. This file is used to sign your app, which lets Google know that it's you who built the app.
      To generate it, we will use the GUI method provided by Android Studio.
      There is also a way to do this with the command line, but we will not cover that in this tutorial.

      <Steps>
        1. Click on `Create new`
          ![Android Studio create new keystore](/native-build-assets/android-studio-create-new-keystore.webp)
        2. Fill in the Key Store path
          ![Android Studio fill in key store path](/native-build-assets/android-studio-fill-in-key-store-path.webp)

            :::caution
            This **IS TO BE SAVED** - it will be used later
            :::
        3. Set the Key Store password
          ![Android Studio set key store password](/native-build-assets/android-studio-set-key-store-password.webp)

            :::note
            I recommend to use the same password for the Key Store and the Key Alias.

            :::
        4. Fill the rest of the form
        
            1. Keep the Key Alias as is (key0)
            2. Fill the certificate details. I have filled it with fake details, but you should fill it with your own details.

            ![Android Studio fill rest of the form](/native-build-assets/android-studio-fill-rest-of-the-form.webp)
        5. Click on `OK`
          ![Android Studio click on OK](/native-build-assets/android-studio-click-on-ok.webp)
      </Steps>
  5. Make sure all of the details for the keystore have been filled in correctly and click on `Next`
    ![Android Studio make sure all of the details for the keystore have been filled in correctly](/native-build-assets/android-studio-make-sure-all-of-the-details-for-the-keystore-have-been-filled-in-correctly.webp)
  6. Select the `release` build variant and click on `Create`
    ![Android Studio select release build variant](/native-build-assets/android-studio-select-release-build-variant.webp)
  7. After the build succeed, you should see the following screen
    ![Android Studio after build succeed](/native-build-assets/android-studio-after-build-succeed.webp)
  
      1. This popout indicated that the build succeeded.
      2. Click on the `locate` button - this will open the file explorer and you should see the build there.
  8. Make sure you can see the build in the file explorer
