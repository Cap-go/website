Capgo is designed with privacy, security, and compliance in mind. This document explains what data is collected, how it's used, and what measures are in place to protect your users' privacy and ensure regulatory compliance when using Capgo's live update service.

## Data Collection Overview

Capgo collects minimal data necessary to provide the live update service effectively. The data collection is focused on operational requirements rather than user tracking or analytics.

### What Data is Collected

Capgo collects only the data that is necessary to provide the live updates feature. When your app checks for updates or downloads new bundles, the following information is collected:

- **App ID**: A unique identifier for your app that is used to associate the app with the correct account
- **App Version Code**: The version code of the app that is used to determine which updates are compatible with the app
- **App Version Name**: The version name of the app that is used for display purposes
- **Platform**: The platform (iOS, Android) of the app that is used to determine which updates are compatible with the app
- **Device ID**: A unique identifier for the device that is used to deliver updates to a specific device and for billing purposes. This identifier is a random string that is created when the app is started for the first time and is reset with every app installation to comply with app store guidelines
- **Bundle ID**: The unique identifier for the bundle that is currently installed on the device
- **Channel Name**: The name of the channel that is selected to receive updates
- **OS Version**: The version of the operating system that is used to determine which updates are compatible with the device
- **Plugin Version**: The version of the Capacitor Live Update plugin that is used to deliver updates to the device

**Additional Technical Data:**
- Update check timestamps
- Download success/failure status
- Bundle installation status
- Rollback events and reasons
- IP address (for geolocation and CDN optimization)

<Aside type="note">
You can verify the data that is collected by inspecting the source code of the Capacitor Live Update plugin, which is open-source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Cap-go/capacitor-updater). Capgo does not collect personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or persistent device identifiers that can be used to track individual users across apps.
</Aside>

### What Data is NOT Collected

Capgo explicitly does not collect:

- Personal user information or credentials
- App usage analytics or user behavior data
- Content from your app or user-generated data
- Location data beyond general geographic region
- Persistent device identifiers for tracking
- Biometric or sensitive personal data

## Data Usage and Purpose

The data collected by Capgo is used exclusively for:

### Service Operation
- Determining which updates are available for specific app versions
- Optimizing content delivery through geographic CDN selection
- Ensuring compatibility between updates and device capabilities
- Managing update rollouts and channel assignments

### Service Improvement
- Monitoring update success rates and identifying issues
- Optimizing download performance and reliability
- Improving the overall update delivery system
- Debugging and troubleshooting update failures

### Security and Integrity
- Preventing abuse and ensuring service availability
- Validating update authenticity and integrity
- Protecting against malicious or corrupted updates
- Maintaining service security and stability

## Data Storage and Retention

### Storage Location
- Update bundles and metadata are stored on secure cloud infrastructure
- Data is distributed across multiple geographic regions for performance
- All data transmission is encrypted using industry-standard protocols (HTTPS/TLS)

### Data Retention
- Update check logs are retained for operational purposes (typically 30-90 days)
- Bundle files are retained as long as they're assigned to active channels
- Aggregated, non-personal metrics may be retained longer for service improvement
- Personal data, if any, is deleted according to applicable data protection laws

### Data Security
- All data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Access to data is restricted to authorized personnel only
- Regular security audits and monitoring are performed
- Industry-standard security practices are followed
- **SOC 2 Certification**: Capgo is currently undergoing SOC 2 Type II audit and will be certified soon, ensuring the highest standards of security, availability, and confidentiality. View our compliance status at [trust.capgo.app](https://trust.capgo.app)
- **Continuous Code Auditing**: Every commit is automatically audited by [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/overall?id=Cap-go_capacitor-updater&branch=main) for the [plugin](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/overall?id=Cap-go_capgo&branch=main) and [backend](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/overall?id=Cap-go_capgo&branch=main), ensuring code quality, security vulnerabilities detection, and maintainability
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Additional security scanning is performed by [Snyk](https://snyk.io/test/github/Cap-go/capgo) to detect and remediate security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Infrastructure Security**: Our hosting infrastructure is continuously monitored and verified through [hosting security checks](https://hosting-checker.net/websites/api.capgo.app)
- **AI-Powered Code Review**: Every pull request is reviewed by CodeRabbit AI to catch potential issues, security concerns, and maintain code quality standards

### App Store Compliance
Capgo strictly adheres to app store guidelines and policies:

- **Apple App Store**: Complies with [App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/) section 3.3.2, ensuring that live updates only modify the app's behavior in ways that are consistent with the submitted app
- **Google Play Store**: Follows [Google Play Developer Policy](https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/) requirements for dynamic code loading and app updates

<Aside type="tip">
**No Additional Privacy Implementation Required**: Capgo is designed to be privacy-compliant by default. You don't need to implement any additional privacy controls or data handling mechanisms in your app code. The minimal data collection and privacy-by-design approach means that integrating Capgo typically doesn't require changes to your existing privacy declarations or policies.
