A Live Update channel points to a specific JS bundle build of your app that will be shared with any devices configured to listen to that channel for updates. When you [install the Capgo Live Updates SDK](/docs/getting-started/quickstart) in your app, any native binary configured to that channel will check for available updates whenever the app is launched. You can change the build a channel points to at any time and can also roll back to previous builds if needed.

## Setting up a Channel

Every app comes with a default channel called "Production" that cannot be deleted. To add new channels:

1. Go to the "Channels" section of the Capgo dashboard 
2. Click the "New Channel" button
3. Enter a name for the channel and click "Create"

Channel names can be anything you'd like. A common strategy is to match channels to your development stages, such as:

- `Development` - for testing live updates on local devices or emulators
- `QA` - for your QA team to verify updates before wider release
- `Staging` - for final testing in a production-like environment 
- `Production` - for the version of your app that end users receive from the app stores

## Configuring the Channel in Your App

With your channels created, you need to configure your app to listen to the appropriate channel. In this example, we'll use the `Development` channel.

Open your `capacitor.config.ts` (or `capacitor.config.json`) file. Under the `plugins` section, set the `channel` property of the `CapacitorUpdater` plugin to the name of your desired channel:

```ts
import { CapacitorConfig } from '@capacitor/cli';

const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  plugins: {
    CapacitorUpdater: {
      channel: 'Development',
    },
  },
};
```

Next, build your web app and run `npx cap sync` to copy the updated config file to your iOS and Android projects. If you skip this sync step, your native projects will continue to use whichever channel they were previously configured for.

## Assigning a Build to a Channel

To deploy a live update, you need to upload a new JS bundle build and assign it to a channel. You can do this in one step with the Capgo CLI:

```shell
npx @capgo/cli@latest upload --channel=Development
```

This will upload your built web assets and set the new bundle as the active build for the `Development` channel. Any apps configured to listen to that channel will receive the update the next time they check for one.

You can also assign builds to channels from the "Builds" section of the Capgo dashboard. Click the menu icon next to a build and select "Assign to Channel" to choose the channel for that build.

## Rolling Back a Live Update

If you deploy a live update that introduces a bug or otherwise needs to be reverted, you can easily roll back to a previous build. From the "Channels" section of the dashboard:

1. Click the name of the channel you want to roll back
2. Find the build you want to revert to and click "Roll Back to Here"
3. Confirm the action 

The selected build will immediately become the active build for that channel again. Apps will receive the rolled back version the next time they check for an update.

## Automating Deployments

For more advanced workflows, you can automate your live update deployments as part of your CI/CD pipeline. By integrating Capgo into your build process, you can automatically upload new bundles and assign them to channels whenever you push to certain branches or create new releases.

Check out the [CI/CD Integration](/docs/cicd-integration) docs to learn more about automating Capgo live updates.

## Deploying to a Device

Now that you understand channels, you're ready to start deploying live updates to real devices. The basic process is:

1. Install the Capgo SDK in your app
2. Configure the app to listen to your desired channel
3. Upload a build and assign it to that channel
4. Launch the app and wait for the update!
