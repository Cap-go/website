Integrate Capgo Live Updates with Bitbucket Pipelines to automatically deploy your app updates whenever you push code changes. This guide covers setting up automated builds, testing, and deployment workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Bitbucket Pipelines integration, ensure you have:

- A Bitbucket account with a repository
- A Capgo account with an app configured
- Node.js and npm/yarn configured in your project

## Setting Up Bitbucket Pipelines

### Step 1: Configure Repository Variables

First, set up the necessary variables in your Bitbucket repository:

<Steps>

1. Navigate to your Bitbucket repository
2. Go to **Repository settings** → **Pipelines** → **Repository variables**
3. Add the following variables:

</Steps>

| Variable Name | Value | Secured |
|---------------|-------|---------|
| `CAPGO_TOKEN` | Your Capgo API token | ✅ Yes |

<Aside type="tip">

Get your Capgo API token from [web.capgo.app/apikeys](https://web.capgo.app/apikeys). Your app ID is already configured in your `capacitor.config.ts` file.

</Aside>

## Simple

Basic configuration that deploys to production on every push to the main branch:

```yaml
# bitbucket-pipelines.yml - Simple Configuration
image: node:22

pipelines:
  branches:
    main:
      - step:
          name: Build and Deploy to Production
          script:
            - npm ci
            - npm run test
            - npm run build
            - npm install -g @capgo/cli
            - npx @capgo/cli bundle upload --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN --channel production
          artifacts:
            - dist/**
```

## Advanced

### Feature Branch Deployments

Deploy feature branches to test channels for review and testing:

```yaml
# Feature branch deployment
pipelines:
  branches:
    feature/*:
      - step:
          name: Deploy Feature Branch
          script:
            - npm ci
            - npm run test
            - npm run build
            - BRANCH_NAME=$(echo $BITBUCKET_BRANCH | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9-]/-/g')
            - CHANNEL_NAME="feature-$BRANCH_NAME"
            - npm install -g @capgo/cli
            - npx @capgo/cli channel create $CHANNEL_NAME --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN || true
            - npx @capgo/cli bundle upload --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN --channel $CHANNEL_NAME
          artifacts:
            - dist/**
```

<Aside type="tip">

**Testing with Channels**: After deploying to a feature channel, you can test the update in your app by configuring it to use that specific channel. Learn more about [configuring channels in your app](/docs/live-updates/channels/#configuring-the-channel-in-your-app).

</Aside>

### Using Encryption

If you're using [Capgo's encryption feature](/docs/live-updates/encryption/), you'll need to store your private key securely in your CI/CD environment.

After [setting up encryption keys](/docs/live-updates/encryption/#setting-up-encryption) locally, add your private key to Bitbucket variables:

```shell
# Display your private key content (copy this output)
cat .capgo_key_v2
```

Add this content as `CAPGO_PRIVATE_KEY` in your Bitbucket repository variables (mark as secured), then use it in pipelines:

```yaml
# Deploy with encryption
- step:
    name: Deploy to Capgo with Encryption
    script:
      - npm install -g @capgo/cli
      - npx @capgo/cli bundle upload --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN --key-data-v2 "$CAPGO_PRIVATE_KEY" --channel production
```

<Aside type="caution">

**Security Best Practices:**
- Never commit the `.capgo_key_v2` file to version control
- Store the private key only in secure CI/CD secret management
- Use different keys for different environments

</Aside>

### Multi-Channel Configuration

For comprehensive information about setting up and managing multiple deployment channels, see the [Channels documentation](/docs/live-updates/channels/).

Complete configuration with multiple environments and pull request deployments:

```yaml
# bitbucket-pipelines.yml - Advanced Multi-Channel Configuration
image: node:22

definitions:
  steps:
    - step: &build-step
        name: Build Application
        script:
          - npm ci
          - npm run test
          - npm run build
        artifacts:
          - dist/**
    
    - step: &deploy-step
        name: Deploy to Capgo
        script:
          - npm install -g @capgo/cli
          - npx @capgo/cli bundle upload --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN --channel $CHANNEL_NAME

pipelines:
  branches:
    main:
      - step:
          <<: *build-step
      - step:
          <<: *deploy-step
          name: Deploy to Production
          deployment: production
          trigger: manual
          script:
            - export CHANNEL_NAME=production
            - npm install -g @capgo/cli
            - npx @capgo/cli bundle upload --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN --channel $CHANNEL_NAME

    develop:
      - step:
          <<: *build-step
      - step:
          <<: *deploy-step
          name: Deploy to Development
          deployment: development
          script:
            - export CHANNEL_NAME=development
            - npm install -g @capgo/cli
            - npx @capgo/cli bundle upload --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN --channel $CHANNEL_NAME

  pull-requests:
    '**':
      - step:
          <<: *build-step
      - step:
          name: Deploy PR to Test Channel
          script:
            - CHANNEL_NAME="pr-$BITBUCKET_PR_ID"
            - npm install -g @capgo/cli
            - npx @capgo/cli channel create $CHANNEL_NAME --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN || true
            - npx @capgo/cli bundle upload --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN --channel $CHANNEL_NAME
          artifacts:
            - dist/**
```

### Multi-Environment Pipeline

For complex deployment scenarios with staging and production environments:

```yaml
# Multi-environment pipeline
image: node:22

pipelines:
  branches:
    main:
      - step:
          name: Build
          script:
            - npm ci
            - npm run test
            - npm run build
          artifacts:
            - dist/**
      - step:
          name: Deploy to Staging
          deployment: staging
          script:
            - npm install -g @capgo/cli
            - npx @capgo/cli bundle upload --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN --channel staging
      - step:
          name: Deploy to Production
          deployment: production
          trigger: manual
          script:
            - npm install -g @capgo/cli
            - npx @capgo/cli bundle upload --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN --channel production

    develop:
      - step:
          name: Build and Deploy to Development
          script:
            - npm ci
            - npm run test
            - npm run build
            - npm install -g @capgo/cli
            - npx @capgo/cli bundle upload --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN --channel development
          artifacts:
            - dist/**
```

### Branch-Based Deployment Strategy

Automatically deploy different branches to appropriate channels:

```yaml
# Dynamic channel deployment
image: node:22

definitions:
  scripts:
    - script: &determine-channel |
        if [ "$BITBUCKET_BRANCH" = "main" ]; then
          export CHANNEL_NAME="production"
        elif [ "$BITBUCKET_BRANCH" = "develop" ]; then
          export CHANNEL_NAME="staging"
        else
          export CHANNEL_NAME="development"
        fi
        echo "Deploying to channel: $CHANNEL_NAME"

pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        name: Build and Deploy
        script:
          - npm ci
          - npm run test
          - npm run build
          - *determine-channel
          - npm install -g @capgo/cli
          - npx @capgo/cli bundle upload --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN --channel $CHANNEL_NAME
        artifacts:
          - dist/**
```

### Parallel Pipeline Execution

Optimize build times with parallel steps:

```yaml
# Parallel execution pipeline
image: node:22

pipelines:
  branches:
    main:
      - parallel:
          - step:
              name: Run Tests
              script:
                - npm ci
                - npm run test
          - step:
              name: Lint Code
              script:
                - npm ci
                - npm run lint
      - step:
          name: Build Application
          script:
            - npm ci
            - npm run build
          artifacts:
            - dist/**
      - step:
          name: Deploy to Production
          deployment: production
          script:
            - npm install -g @capgo/cli
            - npx @capgo/cli bundle upload --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN --channel production
```

## Security Best Practices

### Repository Variables

<Steps>

1. **Secured Variables**: Always mark API tokens as secured
2. **Environment Variables**: Use deployment-specific variables when needed
3. **Access Control**: Limit repository access to authorized team members
4. **Token Rotation**: Regularly rotate your Capgo API tokens

</Steps>

### Deployment Environments

Configure deployment environments for better security:

```yaml
# Deployment with environment restrictions
pipelines:
  branches:
    main:
      - step:
          name: Deploy to Production
          deployment: production
          trigger: manual
          script:
            - npm install -g @capgo/cli
            - npx @capgo/cli bundle upload --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN --channel production
```

## Monitoring and Notifications

### Slack Integration

Add Slack notifications to your pipeline:

```yaml
# Pipeline with Slack notifications
pipelines:
  branches:
    main:
      - step:
          name: Build and Deploy
          script:
            - npm ci
            - npm run test
            - npm run build
            - npm install -g @capgo/cli
            - npx @capgo/cli bundle upload --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN --channel production
          after-script:
            - |
              if [ $BITBUCKET_EXIT_CODE -eq 0 ]; then
                curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
                  --data '{"text":"✅ Capgo deployment successful for '$BITBUCKET_BRANCH'"}' \
                  $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
              else
                curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
                  --data '{"text":"❌ Capgo deployment failed for '$BITBUCKET_BRANCH'"}' \
                  $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
              fi
```

### Email Notifications

Configure email notifications through Bitbucket's built-in features or using external services:

```yaml
# Email notification step
- step:
    name: Send Notification
    script:
      - |
        curl -X POST \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{
            "to": "team@yourcompany.com",
            "subject": "Capgo Deployment Status",
            "body": "Deployment of '$BITBUCKET_BRANCH' completed with status: '$BITBUCKET_EXIT_CODE'"
          }' \
          $EMAIL_SERVICE_URL
    condition:
      result: [successful, failed]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Pipeline fails with "Capgo CLI not found":**
```yaml
# Debug CLI installation
- step:
    name: Debug CLI
    script:
      - npm install -g @capgo/cli
      - which capgo || echo "Capgo CLI not found"
      - npx @capgo/cli --version
```

**Authentication errors:**
```yaml
# Verify token configuration
- step:
    name: Debug Auth
    script:
      - |
        if [ -z "$CAPGO_TOKEN" ]; then
          echo "CAPGO_TOKEN is not set"
          exit 1
        fi
        echo "Token length: ${#CAPGO_TOKEN}"
```

**Build artifacts not found:**
```yaml
# List build outputs
- step:
    name: Debug Build
    script:
      - ls -la dist/
      - find dist/ -type f -name "*.js" -o -name "*.html"
```

### Debug Pipeline

Add debugging information to troubleshoot issues:

```yaml
# Debug pipeline
pipelines:
  branches:
    main:
      - step:
          name: Debug Information
          script:
            - echo "Branch: $BITBUCKET_BRANCH"
            - echo "Commit: $BITBUCKET_COMMIT"
            - echo "Build: $BITBUCKET_BUILD_NUMBER"
            - env | grep BITBUCKET_ | sort
      - step:
          name: Build and Deploy
          script:
            - npm ci
            - npm run test
            - npm run build
            - npm install -g @capgo/cli
            - npx @capgo/cli bundle upload --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN --channel production
```

### Pipeline Validation

Enable pipeline validation to catch configuration errors:

```yaml
# Enable pipeline validation
options:
  docker: true
  size: 2x

pipelines:
  branches:
    main:
      - step:
          name: Validate Pipeline
          script:
            - echo "Pipeline validation successful"
      - step:
          name: Build and Deploy
          script:
            # ... deployment steps
```
