Integrate Capgo Live Updates with GitLab CI/CD to automatically deploy your app updates whenever you push code changes. This guide covers setting up automated builds, testing, and deployment workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up GitLab CI/CD integration, ensure you have:

- A GitLab account with a project repository
- A Capgo account with an app configured
- Node.js and npm/yarn configured in your project

## Setting Up GitLab CI/CD

### Step 1: Configure Environment Variables

First, set up the necessary variables in your GitLab project:

<Steps>

1. Navigate to your GitLab project
2. Go to **Settings** → **CI/CD** → **Variables**
3. Add the following variables:

</Steps>

| Variable Name | Value | Protected | Masked |
|---------------|-------|-----------|--------|
| `CAPGO_TOKEN` | Your Capgo API token | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

<Aside type="tip">

Get your Capgo API token from [web.capgo.app/apikeys](https://web.capgo.app/apikeys). Your app ID is already configured in your `capacitor.config.ts` file.

## Simple

Basic configuration that deploys to production on every push to the main branch:

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml - Simple Configuration
image: node:22

stages:
  - build
  - deploy

variables:
  npm_config_cache: "$CI_PROJECT_DIR/.npm"

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npm run test
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/
    expire_in: 1 hour
  only:
    - main

deploy_production:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npm install -g @capgo/cli
    - npx @capgo/cli bundle upload --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN --channel production
  dependencies:
    - build
  only:
    - main
```

## Advanced

### Feature Branch Deployments

Deploy feature branches to test channels for review and testing:

```yaml
# Feature branch deployment
deploy_feature:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npm install -g @capgo/cli
    - CHANNEL_NAME="feature-$(echo $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9-]/-/g')"
    - npx @capgo/cli channel create $CHANNEL_NAME --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN || true
    - npx @capgo/cli bundle upload --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN --channel $CHANNEL_NAME
  dependencies:
    - build
  only:
    - /^feature\/.*$/
  environment:
    name: feature/$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME
    url: https://your-app.com/channels/$CHANNEL_NAME
```

<Aside type="tip">

**Testing with Channels**: After deploying to a feature channel, you can test the update in your app by configuring it to use that specific channel. Learn more about [configuring channels in your app](/docs/live-updates/channels/#configuring-the-channel-in-your-app).

</Aside>

### Multi-Channel Configuration

Complete configuration with multiple environments and merge request deployments:

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml - Advanced Multi-Channel Configuration
image: node:22

stages:
  - build
  - deploy

variables:
  npm_config_cache: "$CI_PROJECT_DIR/.npm"

# Build stage
build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npm run test
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/
    expire_in: 24 hours

# Deploy to development channel
deploy_development:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npm install -g @capgo/cli
    - npx @capgo/cli bundle upload --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN --channel development
  dependencies:
    - build
  only:
    - develop
  environment:
    name: development

# Deploy merge requests to test channels
deploy_mr:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npm install -g @capgo/cli
    - CHANNEL_NAME="mr-$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID"
    - npx @capgo/cli channel create $CHANNEL_NAME --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN || true
    - npx @capgo/cli bundle upload --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN --channel $CHANNEL_NAME
  dependencies:
    - build
  only:
    - merge_requests
  environment:
    name: review/$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID
    url: https://your-app.com/channels/mr-$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID
    on_stop: cleanup_mr

# Cleanup MR channels when MR is closed
cleanup_mr:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npm install -g @capgo/cli
    - npx @capgo/cli channel delete mr-$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN || true
  when: manual
  environment:
    name: review/$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID
    action: stop
  only:
    - merge_requests

# Deploy to staging
deploy_staging:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npm install -g @capgo/cli
    - npx @capgo/cli bundle upload --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN --channel staging
  dependencies:
    - build
  only:
    - develop
  environment:
    name: staging

# Deploy to production
deploy_production:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npm install -g @capgo/cli
    - npx @capgo/cli bundle upload --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN --channel production
  dependencies:
    - build
  only:
    - main
  environment:
    name: production
```

### Multi-Environment with Manual Approval

For production deployments requiring manual approval:

```yaml
deploy_production:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npm install -g @capgo/cli
    - npx @capgo/cli bundle upload --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN --channel production
  dependencies:
    - build
  only:
    - main
  when: manual
  environment:
    name: production
```

### Branch-Based Deployment Strategy

Deploy different branches to appropriate channels automatically:

```yaml
# Dynamic channel deployment based on branch
deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npm install -g @capgo/cli
    - |
      if [ "$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME" = "main" ]; then
        CHANNEL="production"
      elif [ "$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME" = "develop" ]; then
        CHANNEL="staging"
      else
        CHANNEL="development"
      fi
    - npx @capgo/cli bundle upload --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN --channel $CHANNEL
  dependencies:
    - build
  environment:
    name: $CHANNEL
```

## Security Best Practices

### Protected Variables

<Steps>

1. **Mark Sensitive Variables**: Always mark API tokens as protected and masked
2. **Branch Protection**: Use protected variables for production deployments
3. **Access Control**: Limit variable access to maintainers only
4. **Regular Rotation**: Rotate API tokens regularly

</Steps>

### Secure Pipeline Configuration

```yaml
# Use protected variables for production
deploy_production:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npm install -g @capgo/cli
    - npx @capgo/cli bundle upload --apikey $CAPGO_TOKEN --channel production
  only:
    refs:
      - main
    variables:
      - $CI_COMMIT_REF_PROTECTED == "true"
```

## Monitoring and Notifications

### Slack Integration

Add Slack notifications to your pipeline:

```yaml
notify_success:
  stage: .post
  image: alpine:latest
  before_script:
    - apk add --no-cache curl
  script:
    - |
      curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
        --data '{"text":"✅ Capgo deployment successful for '"$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME"'"}' \
        $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
  when: on_success

notify_failure:
  stage: .post
  image: alpine:latest
  before_script:
    - apk add --no-cache curl
  script:
    - |
      curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
        --data '{"text":"❌ Capgo deployment failed for '"$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME"'"}' \
        $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
  when: on_failure
```

### Email Notifications

Configure email notifications in your GitLab project settings or use the API:

```yaml
notify_email:
  stage: .post
  script:
    - |
      curl --request POST \
        --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: $GITLAB_API_TOKEN" \
        --form "to=team@yourcompany.com" \
        --form "subject=Capgo Deployment Status" \
        --form "body=Deployment of $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME completed with status: $CI_JOB_STATUS" \
        "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/$CI_PROJECT_ID/emails"
  when: always
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Pipeline fails with "Capgo CLI not found":**
```yaml
# Debug CLI installation
debug_cli:
  script:
    - npm install -g @capgo/cli
    - which capgo || echo "Capgo CLI not found"
    - npx @capgo/cli --version
```

**Authentication errors:**
```yaml
# Verify token configuration
debug_auth:
  script:
    - |
      if [ -z "$CAPGO_TOKEN" ]; then
        echo "CAPGO_TOKEN is not set"
        exit 1
      fi
      echo "Token length: ${#CAPGO_TOKEN}"
```

**Build artifacts not found:**
```yaml
# List build outputs
debug_build:
  script:
    - ls -la dist/
    - find dist/ -type f -name "*.js" -o -name "*.html"
```

### Debug Pipeline

Add debugging information to troubleshoot issues:

```yaml
debug:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Branch: $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME"
    - echo "Commit: $CI_COMMIT_SHA"
    - echo "Build: $CI_PIPELINE_ID"
    - env | grep CI_ | sort
  only:
    - branches
```

## Next Steps
