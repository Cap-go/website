API keys are used to authenticate requests to the Capgo API. Each key can have different permissions (modes) to control access levels. Keys are organization-specific and should be managed carefully as they grant access to your Capgo resources.

## Key Modes

- **read**: Can only read data, no modifications allowed
- **upload**: Can read, modify, and upload new bundles
- **write**: Can read, modify data, and upload bundles
- **all**: Full access to all operations

Key modes follow a stepped/gradual schema. If you have a upload key, and then you create an write key, the write key will be able to do everything that the upload key could.
Please take a look at the following diagram to better understand how API key work.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Always use the most restrictive mode that still allows your integration to function
2. **Regular Rotation**: Rotate your API keys periodically
3. **Secure Storage**: Store API keys securely and never commit them to version control
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor API key usage and revoke any compromised keys immediately

## Endpoints

### GET

`https://api.capgo.app/apikey/`

Retrieve all API keys associated with your account.

#### Response Type

```typescript
interface ApiKey {
  created_at: string | null
  id: number
  key: string
  mode: 'read' | 'write' | 'upload' | 'all'
  name: string
  updated_at: string | null
  user_id: string
}
```

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -H "authorization: your-api-key" https://api.capgo.app/apikey/
```

#### Example Response

{
  "data": [
    {

      "updated_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "user_id": "user_123"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "key": "ak_456...",
      "mode": "upload",
      "name": "Deploy Bot",
      "created_at": "2024-01-02T00:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-01-02T00:00:00Z",
      "user_id": "user_123"
    }
  ]
}
```

### POST

`https://api.capgo.app/apikey/`

Create a new API key for a specific organization.

#### Query Parameters

```typescript
interface ApiKeyCreate {
  org_id: string
  mode: 'read' | 'write' | 'upload' | 'all'
}
```

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "authorization: your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "org_id": "org_123",
    "mode": "read"
  }' \
  https://api.capgo.app/apikey/
```

#### Example Response

```json
{
  "apikey": {
    "id": 3,
    "key": "ak_789...",
    "mode": "read",
    "name": "New API Key",
    "created_at": "2024-02-12T00:00:00Z",
    "user_id": "user_123"
  }
}
```

### DELETE

`https://api.capgo.app/apikey/:key/`

Delete an existing API key. Use this to revoke access immediately.

#### Parameters
- `key`: The API key to delete (the UUID-like string) or the `id` of the API key

#### Example Request

```bash
# Delete by key
curl -X DELETE -H "authorization: your-api-key" https://api.capgo.app/apikey/ak_123.../

# Delete by ID
curl -X DELETE -H "authorization: your-api-key" https://api.capgo.app/apikey/1/
```

#### Success Response

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

## Common Use Cases

1. **CI/CD Integration**: Create read-only keys for CI pipelines to check deployment status
2. **Deployment Automation**: Use upload mode keys for automated deployment scripts
3. **Monitoring Tools**: Use read mode keys for external monitoring integrations
4. **Admin Access**: Use all mode keys sparingly for administrative tools

## Error Handling

Common error scenarios and their responses:

```json
// Invalid mode
{
  "error": "Invalid mode specified. Must be one of: read, write, upload, all",
  "status": "KO"
}

// Key not found
{
  "error": "API key not found",
  "status": "KO"
}

// Permission denied
{
  "error": "Insufficient permissions to manage API keys",
  "status": "KO"
}
```
