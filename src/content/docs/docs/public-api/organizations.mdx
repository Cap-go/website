## Error Handling

Common error scenarios and their responses:

```json
// Invalid API key
{
  "error": "Invalid API key",
  "status": "KO"
}

// Missing required field

  "error": "Name is required",

## Best Practices

1. **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for organizations
2. **Roles**: Assign appropriate roles to team members
3. **Email**: Use a group email for management_email to avoid issues with personal email changes
4. **Logo**: Host logos on a reliable CDN and use HTTPS URLs
