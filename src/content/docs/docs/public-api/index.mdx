This is the documentation of the public API of Capgo cloud. The API allows you to programmatically manage your Capgo resources, including organizations, devices, channels, and bundles. It's designed to be RESTful and uses standard HTTP methods.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication. To authenticate your requests, add your API key in the `authorization` header.

Example:
```bash
curl -H "authorization: your-api-key" https://api.capgo.app/organization/
```

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage. Current limits are:
- 100 requests per minute for standard accounts
- 1000 requests per minute for enterprise accounts

If you exceed these limits, you'll receive a 429 (Too Many Requests) response.

## Response Format

All responses are in JSON format. Successful responses typically include either a `data` object or a `status` field. Error responses include an `error` field with a description of what went wrong.

Example success response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

Example error response:
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid API key",
  "status": "KO"
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**: Always check for error responses and handle them appropriately
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement exponential backoff when hitting rate limits
3. **Caching**: Cache responses when appropriate to reduce API calls
4. **Versioning**: Keep track of API changes through our changelog
