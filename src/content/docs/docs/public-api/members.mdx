Organization members are users who have access to your Capgo organization. Each member has a specific role that determines their permissions within the organization. Managing members effectively is crucial for maintaining security and collaboration in your team.

## Member Roles

### Regular Roles
- **read**: Can view resources but cannot make changes
- **upload**: Can upload new bundles and view resources
- **write**: Can modify resources and upload bundles
- **admin**: Can manage organization settings and members
- **super_admin**: Has full control over the organization

### Invite Roles
- **invite_read**: Pending invitation for read access
- **invite_upload**: Pending invitation for upload access
- **invite_write**: Pending invitation for write access
- **invite_admin**: Pending invitation for admin access
- **invite_super_admin**: Pending invitation for super admin access

## Best Practices

1. **Role Assignment**: Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning roles
2. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review member access and remove unused accounts
3. **Onboarding**: Have a clear process for adding new members and assigning roles
4. **Offboarding**: Promptly remove access for members who leave the organization
