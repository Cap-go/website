Organization members are users who have access to your Capgo organization. Each member has a specific role that determines their permissions within the organization. Managing members effectively is crucial for maintaining security and collaboration in your team.

## Member Roles

### Regular Roles
- **read**: Can view resources but cannot make changes
- **upload**: Can upload new bundles and view resources
- **write**: Can modify resources and upload bundles
- **admin**: Can manage organization settings and members
- **super_admin**: Has full control over the organization

### Invite Roles
- **invite_read**: Pending invitation for read access
- **invite_upload**: Pending invitation for upload access
- **invite_write**: Pending invitation for write access
- **invite_admin**: Pending invitation for admin access
- **invite_super_admin**: Pending invitation for super admin access

## Best Practices

1. **Role Assignment**: Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning roles
2. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review member access and remove unused accounts
3. **Onboarding**: Have a clear process for adding new members and assigning roles
4. **Offboarding**: Promptly remove access for members who leave the organization

## Endpoints

### POST

`https://api.capgo.app/organization/members/`

Add a new member to an organization or update an existing member's role. Note that you can only invite users who already have a Capgo account - the email must correspond to an existing Capgo user.

#### Request Body

```typescript
interface MemberCreate {
  orgId: string
  email: string
  role: "read" | "upload" | "write" | "admin" | "super_admin"
}
```

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "authorization: your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "orgId": "org_123",
    "email": "newmember@example.com",
    "role": "write"
  }' \
  https://api.capgo.app/organization/members/
```

#### Success Response

```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "data": {
    "uid": "user_789",
    "email": "newmember@example.com",
    "role": "invite_write",
    "image_url": null
  }
}
```

Notes: 
- When adding a new member, they will receive an invitation email. Their role will be prefixed with "invite_" until they accept the invitation.
- The user must already have a Capgo account before they can be invited. If they don't have an account, they should first create one at https://web.capgo.app/register/
