This documentation will explain how to run your own auto-update server.

## Before start

If you use this work on your own, I couldn't suggest you more to support my work thought [Github support](https://github.com/sponsors/riderx/).

I made a big bet to open source all the precious code I built here.

I could have kept it for myself and put a high ticket price.

Furthermore, I want to focus on Capgo tooling, and make it an open and transparent business.

Likewise, I do think it would make our world a better place by opening instead of fighting and hiding.

But to make it possible, it is necessary for all of us to do our part, including you ü•π.

Capgo offer can't suit you, then put your price and back a bootstrapped Maker [HERE](https://github.com/sponsors/riderx/) on your terms.

## Features parity

If you choose to go with your server, you lose the 5-min setup flow.\
You need to implement yourself all features.\

Here is the list:

| Features                 | Capgo | Self hosted |
| ------------------------ | ----- | ----------- |
| Updates                  | ‚úÖ     | üöß          |

| Email alert on fail      | ‚úÖ     | üöß          |

| Auto set channel         | ‚úÖ     | üöß          |
| API Channels             | ‚úÖ     | üöß          |
| Updates Statistics       | ‚úÖ     | üöß          |

| Update encryption        | ‚úÖ     | üöß          |

> Be mindful that you can't use the Capgo cloud and your server at the same time.

## Choose between Auto and Manual

:::danger
‚ö†Ô∏è Update OTA(Over the Air) only works on HTML, CSS, JS changes.\
When you update native code (capacitor plugin), you must resubmit to the app store.
:::

In auto mode, part of the logic is handled by the Native code, updates are decided server side, this is more secure and allows fine grain update, partial deploy to one device or group and more.

In manual mode, all the logic is handled by the JS, that some good and some bad in both scenarios.

### Prepare your bundle

To send updates to your app, you need to zip it.
The best way to be certain your zip is good is to use the Capgo CLI for zipping.

`npx @capgo/cli@latest bundle zip` will create your zip ready to be uploaded in your backend.
