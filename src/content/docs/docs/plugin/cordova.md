You are many to wonder if this plugin will be available in Cordova.

I have started a R\&D repository for that, but it's a huge work.

## Problems

I know I can do it. For that, I have to read all the code of Cordova codebase as I did for Capacitor, to understand how to make it work.

The Android version is easier to do since both use Java, but iOS needs a full rewrite because Swift is still not well-supported in Cordova

## Solution

We have many solutions to solve that :

* [Support me](https://github.com/sponsors/riderx) on GitHub and I can prioritize that. This will need at least 1 month of work.
* Hire me as a Consultant, I used to help big companies migrate to capacitor, it usually takes from 10 to 20 days, and the [benefit](https://ionic.io/resources/articles/capacitor-vs-cordova-modern-hybrid-app-development) is huge for the team
* Wait until this comes out, it is very low on the to-do for now.
