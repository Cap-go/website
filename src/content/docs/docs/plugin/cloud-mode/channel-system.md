Capgo and capacitor-updater comes with a powerful channel system.

## What you can do with channels:

* Associate devices to channel for development, beta test
* Use one channel by dev branch and let your team self-assign from the phone to test

## Assigning devices to a channel:

* Make the channel default, each time a new device asks Capgo for an update this channel will answer
* Send the **deviceId** (with [**getDeviceId**](/docs/plugin/api#getdeviceid) method) to your backend and assign it with Capgo public API
* Make the channel self-assignable (with [**setChannel**](/docs/plugin/api#setchannel) method), and let the device subscribe to the channel (with user interaction or not) with method `setChannel` of the plugin.
* Use the option `defaultChannel` in the [config](/docs/plugin/settings#defaultchannel) to set the default channel for all devices with this plugin configuration. The name is case sentive

:::note
You can also assign a device directly to a bundle.

:::note
Capgo is doing some automatic filtering for you. If you have a CI/CD configured to send your version to Google Play, Google Play will run your app each time to 20+ real devices. During the first 4 hours of a new bundle, we will block Google data center IPs to prevent them from being counted in your stats.

:::note 
Capgo **does not** count emulator and dev builds in your usage, but keep in mind that you can't have more than 3% of them, or your account will be locked until you fix it.
