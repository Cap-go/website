## Understanding device logs:

### Debug command:

There is a debug command for Capgo cloud users.

```bash
npx @capgo/cli@latest app debug
```

This will allow you to check all event happening in app and find solution if update don't happen.

### IOS

### Android:

to find your logs on Android studio

### Explainations

* `Failed to download from` **=>** same as **download\_fail**
* `notifyAppReady was not called, roll back current bundle` => same as as **update\_fail**

## Finding the downloaded bundle in your device

### iOS

To debug on iOS, you need to dump the app on your computer, you can do it like that :

Xcode has a built-in feature for inspecting the file system of developer installed apps on an iOS device.

To achieve this:

* Connect your device to your Mac and select Window > Devices in the Xcode menubar.
* Select your device in the left pane under the Devices section.
* This will show a list of developer installed apps for that device.
* Select the app you want to inspect and then the select the gear icon near the bottom of the screen.
* Here you can view the current file system by selecting Show Container or download a snapshot of it.

Selecting Download Container... will download and export a snapshot of the file system as a .xcappdata file that you can browse through.

Right-click on this file and select Show Package Contents to open the folder.

Open the App Data folder, and you should now see a few folders like Documents, Library, tmp, etc.

Then you will find version in 2 folders:

`library/NoCloud/ionic_built_snapshots` who is necessary after app reboot

and `documents/versions` for hot reload

### Android

To debug on Android, you need to access the device from Android Studio:

* Click View > Tool Windows > Device File Explorer or click the Device File Explorer button in the tool window bar to open the Device File Explorer.
* Select a device from the dropdown list.
* Open the path **data/data/APP\_NAME/** where **APP\_NAME is your app ID.**

Then Find the `versions` folder to see all the folder versions

:::tip[Did you know?]
On android all version are stored in one folder, unlike IOS where it has to be duplicated in two location.
