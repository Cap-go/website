This documentation will explain how to run your auto-update server.

## Serve your bundle
Make sure your bundle is served over HTTPS, and the server has the right CORS headers to allow the app to download the update.
e.g. ```https://myserver.com/app/updates/updates.json```


If you're unfamiliar with serving a bundle, we recommend you try Capgo Cloud or see an example here:
<LinkCard
	title="Serving a Bundle"
	href="/docs/self-hosted/auto-update/update-endpoint"
/>

## Configuration
Add an ``updateUrl`` to your ``capacitor.config.json``.

```json
{
	"plugins": {
		"CapacitorUpdater": {
			"updateUrl": "https://myserver.com/app/updates/updates.json",
		}
	}
}
```
:::caution
When you are pushing a self-hosted update, be mindful you cannot use "HTTP" endpoint as it's against the security policies of Android apps, for testing purposes you can [allow it](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45940861/android-8-cleartext-http-traffic-not-permitted).

## Update API

The plugin will do a POST call to your API each time the app is open, with this body:

```typescript
interface AppInfos {
    "platform": "ios" | "android",
    "device_id": "UUID_of_device_unique_by_install",
    "app_id": "APPID_FROM_CAPACITOR_CONFIG",
    "custom_id": "your_custom_id_set_on_runtime",
    "plugin_version": "PLUGIN_VERSION",
    "version_build": "VERSION_NUMBER_FROM_NATIVE_CODE",
    "version_code": "VERSION_CODE_FROM_NATIVE_CODE",
    "version_name": "LAST_DOWNLOADER_VERSION" | "builtin"
    "version_os": "VERSION_OF_SYSYEM_OS",
    "is_emulator": boolean,
    "is_prod": boolean,
}
```

The server API should respond, in JSON, to the capacitor-updater plugin. With this data if an update is necessary:

```json
{
"version": "1.2.3",
"url": "https://myserver.com/app/updates/my-new-app-2.0.0.zip"
}
```

In Auto-update mode the server should compare the versions and return the right one, if the URL key is present, the plugin starts the download process.

If you add "message" and "error" key, the version will not be set, and the message will be displayed in logs instead.

`version` key should be in [`semver`](https://semver.org/) format.

The zip should have `index.html` as a file at the root, or only one folder at the root with `index.html` inside.


You can use the command of the CLI to zip your bundle:

```bash title="Create a bundle with your files to serve from your server"
npx @capgo/cli bundle zip --path [/path/to/my/bundle]
```
