## End-to-end Encryption

Starting with version 4.15.0 the plugin allows you to send encrypted updates.
To begin start by creating a private key.
```bash title='Create a private key'
npx @capgo/cli key create
```

Then you encrypt your zip
```bash title="Encrypt bundled zip"
npx @capgo/cli encrypt [path/to/zip]
```

The command will print you a `ivSessionKey` it has to be sent with your update payload in the key `session_key`.

```json
{
"version": "1.2.3",
"url": "https://myserver.com/app/updates/my-new-app-2.0.0.zip",
"session_key": "encrypted_session_key",
}
```
Then your app will be able to use the private key to decrypt the `session_key` and use the decrypted `session_key` to decrypt the update.
