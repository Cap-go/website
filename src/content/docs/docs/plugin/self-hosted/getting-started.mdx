This documentation will explain how to run your own auto-update server.

## Introduction

If you find this work helpful, please consider supporting my work by becoming a [Github sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/riderx).

I made a bet to open-source all the code I built here instead of paywalling it. By opening it up instead of fighting and hiding, I believe we can make the world a better place.

Furthermore, I want to focus on Capgo tooling, and make it an open and transparent business.

But to make it possible, it is necessary for all of us to do our part, including you ðŸ¥¹.

If Capgo doesn't suit you, then pay your own price and [back a bootstrapped Maker](https://github.com/sponsors/riderx) on your terms.

## Features parity

If you choose to go with your own server, you will lose the 5-min setup flow.\
You need to implement all of these features yourself.

:::danger
If you send a bad update to your users you can and will break their app.
:::

> Be mindful that you can't use the Capgo cloud and your server at the same time.



:::danger
The Over-the-Air (OTA) update feature is applicable only for modifications made to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

If you make any changes to the native code, such as updates to Capacitor plugins, it is mandatory to resubmit the application to the app store for approval.
:::

## Choose between Auto and Manual
In auto mode, part of the logic is handled by the Native code, updates are decided server side, this is more secure and allows fine grain updates, partial deployment to one device or group and more.

In manual mode, all the logic is handled by the JS.

## Install Capacitor updater

```bash title="Install the Capacitor updater"
npm install @capgo/capacitor-updater
npx cap sync
```

## Prepare your bundle

To send updates to your app, you need to zip it.
The best way to be certain your zip is good is to use the Capgo CLI for zipping.
```bash title="Create a bundle with your files to serve from your server"
npx @capgo/cli@latest bundle zip
```


You will have to serve this zip from your server on your own.
