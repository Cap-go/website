## What this tutorial will cover?

This tutorial will show how to start the supabase from scratch as well as start edge functions 

## Requirements
 1. Cloned [capgo](https://github.com/Cap-go/capgo)
 3. [supabase](https://supabase.com/)

## Getting started

To get started run
```bash
supabase start
```

Next should see something like this:
```js
Started supabase local development setup.

         API URL: http://localhost:54321
     GraphQL URL: http://localhost:54321/graphql/v1
          DB URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres
      Studio URL: http://localhost:54323
    Inbucket URL: http://localhost:54324
      JWT secret: [truncated]
        anon key: supa_key_anon
service_role key: supa_key_admin
```

Next open `configs.json` and set the following values:
```json
{
  "base_domain": {
    "prod": "web.capgo.app",
    "development": "development.web.capgo.app",
    "local": "localhost:3332"
  },
  "supa_anon": {
    "prod": "supa_key_anon",
    "development": "supa_key_anon",
    "local": "supa_key_anon"
  },
  "supa_url": {
    "prod": "http://localhost:54321",
    "development": "http://localhost:54321",
    "local": "http://localhost:54321"
  }
}
```

where `supa_key_anon` is the value from the previous step.

:::danger
⚠️ Do not commit `configs.json` into the remote repo
:::

Next, verify that you can go to [localhost:54323](http://localhost:54323/projects) and that the table `users` looks something like this

If it does start edge functions by running:

```bash
supabase functions serve
```

and start fronend by running:
```bash
bun run serve
```
