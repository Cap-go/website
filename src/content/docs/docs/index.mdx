## Choose Your Mode

- **Cloud Auto Mode:**  <br/> Logic is handled by Capgo backend, providing enhanced security and fine-grained updates. You can deploy updates to specific devices or groups.
- **Cloud Manual Mode:**  <br/> Update logic is handled by your JS, while Capgo backend handles the update content.
- **Self-hosted Auto Mode:**  <br/> You need to recreate the update logic in your backend.
- **Self-hosted Manual Mode:**  <br/> Update logic is handled by your JS, while the server handles the updates.
- **Manual Mode without Backend:**  <br/> All logic must be handled by your JS.


⚠️ Please note that using **Manual Mode** can lead to complex issues since the code for the update is shipped within the update itself.

## Roadmap

The roadmap is managed on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/Cap-go/projects/1).

## Open source

The plugin is under the LGPL-3.0 License and the back-end is AGPL-3.0 License.

> 💡 LGPL-3.0 means if someone modifies the code of the plugin, it’s mandatory to publish it, in open-source with the same licensing. If you use the code without modification, that doesn’t concern you. See the issue below for more details check the link 👇

> You can include it in your app without worrying

## Last words

If you self-host and find this tool useful, please consider supporting my work by becoming a [GitHub sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/riderx).

I made a bet to open-source all the code I built here instead of keeping it for myself and charging a high price. By opening up instead of fighting and hiding, I believe we can make the world a better place.

To make this possible, it's necessary for all of us to do our part, including you 🥹. If Capgo cloud doesn't meet your needs, you can back a bootstrapped Maker [here](https://github.com/sponsors/riderx) on your own terms.
