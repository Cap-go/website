## Choose between all modes

In **cloud auto mode,** logic is handled by **Capgo** backend, updates are decided server side, this is more secure and allow fine grain update, partial deploy to one device or group and more.\
In **cloud manual mode** the logic of when update is handled by your **JS**, the **Capgo** backend still handle the what to update.

In **self-hosted** **auto mode**, you have to recreate the update logic in your backend.\
In **self-hosted manual mode** the logic of when update is handled by your **JS,** the server still handle the what to update.\
Or lastly you can go in **manual mode without backend**, all the logic have to be handled by your **JS.**

\
**Manual mode** can lead to very complex issue since you ship the code for update withing the update itself.

### Cloud Auto

<summary>Good ‚úÖ</summary>

* No logic to handle, all is done for you
* Auto-revert is handle for you
* Statistics of updates available
* Possibility to revert user
* Channels to share version to your team or users
* Define advanced strategies like AB test or partial deploy
* 5 min to configure and then you forgot about it

</details>

<details>

<summary>Bad ü•≤</summary>

## Last words

If you use this tool for free, take time to support my work with [GitHub sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/riderx).

I made a bet to open source all the code I built here.

I could have kept it for myself and put a high ticket price.

Instead, I want to make it an open and transparent business.

I do think it would make our world a better place by opening instead of fighting and hiding.

To make it possible, it is necessary for all of us to do our part, including you ü•π.

If Capgo cloud offer can't suit you, back a bootstrapped Maker [HERE](https://github.com/sponsors/riderx) on your own terms.
