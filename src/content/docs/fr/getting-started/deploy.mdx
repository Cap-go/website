### Dépannage Uploads

If your Télécharger fails, double Vérifier:
- Your app ID in `capacitor.config.ts` matches your app in the Capgo dashboard
- You're running the Télécharger Commande from the root of your Capacitor project
- Your web assets are built and up to date

If you're still having trouble, go to the [Dépannage](/docs/getting-started/Dépannage/) section.

## Receiving an Mise à jour on a Appareil

Once your Bundle is uploaded, you can Test the live Mise à jour on a Appareil:

1. Synchroniser your Application to the Appareil:
   ```shell
   npx cap sync ios
   ```

2. Open another Terminal and run the following Commande to Vérifier the Mise à jour status:
   ```shell
   npx @capgo/cli@latest app debug
   ```

3. Run your Application locally:
   ```shell
   npx cap run ios
   ``` 
   Or open the iOS/Android project in Xcode/Android Studio and do a Natif run.

4. Keep the Application open for À propos 30 seconds to allow the Mise à jour to Télécharger in the background. 

5. The Journaux will take a few seconds to Mise à jour and show the Mise à jour status.

6. Close and reopen the Application. You should see your live Mise à jour applied!
