### Télécharger failures

If your Bundle Télécharger fails, double Vérifier:
- Your app ID in `capacitor.config.ts` matches your app in the Capgo dashboard
- You're running the Télécharger Commande from the root of your Capacitor project 
- Your web assets are built and up to date

#### Advanced Télécharger Options

The Capgo CLI provides some additional flags to Aide with common Télécharger issues:

- `--tus`: Uses the [tus resumable upload protocol](https://tus.io/) for more reliable uploads of large bundles or on poor network connections. If your bundle is over 10MB or you're on a spotty connection, consider using `--tus`:
  ```shell
  npx @capgo/cli@latest bundle upload --tus
  ```

- `--package-json` and `--node-modules`: Tells Capgo where to find your root `package.json` and `node_modules` if your app uses a non-standard structure like a monorepo or npm workspace. Pass the path to the root `package.json` and the `--node_modules` path:
  ```shell
  npx @capgo/cli@latest bundle upload --package-json=path/to/package.json --node_modules=path/to/node_modules
  ```
  Capgo needs this Information to correctly Bundle your Application's dependencies.

You can combine these flags with other options like `--channel` as needed. See the [Capgo CLI docs](/docs/cli/overview/) for full details on the available upload options.

If you're still having trouble with uploads, reach out to [Capgo Support](https://Support.capgo.Application) for further assistance.

### Débogage Mises à jour

If you're encountering issues with Mises à jour en direct, the Capgo Débogage Commande is a helpful tool for Dépannage. To use it:

1. Run the following Commande in your project directory:
   ```shell
   npx @capgo/cli@latest app debug
   ```

2. Launch your Application on a Appareil or emulator and perform the action that should trigger an Mise à jour (e.g. reopening the Application after uploading a Nouveau Bundle).

3. Watch the output of the Débogage Commande. It will Journal Information À propos the Mise à jour process, including:
   - When the Application checks for an Mise à jour
   - If an Mise à jour is found and what Version it is
   - Télécharger and Installation progress for the Mise à jour
   - Any errors that occur during the Mise à jour process

4. Use the Débogage Journaux to identify where the Problème is occurring. For Exemple:
   - If no Mise à jour is found, double Vérifier that your Bundle was uploaded successfully and the Application is configured to use the correct Canal.
   - If the update downloads but doesn't install, make sure you've called `CapacitorUpdater.notifyAppReady()` and that the app was fully closed and reopened.
   - If you see an Erreur message, look up that specific Erreur in the Capgo docs or reach out to Support for Aide.

The Débogage Commande is especially useful for identifying issues with the Mise à jour Télécharger and Installation process. If the Journaux show the expected Mise à jour Version was found but not ultimately applied, focus your Dépannage on the steps after the Télécharger.

### Débogage with Natif Journaux

In addition to the Capgo Débogage Commande, the Natif Journaux on Android and iOS can provide valuable Dépannage Information, especially for issues on the Natif side of the Mise à jour process.

#### Android Journaux

To access the Android Journaux:

1. Connect your Appareil or Démarrer your emulator
2. Open Android Studio and select "View > Tool Windows > Logcat" 
3. In the Logcat window, filter the Journaux to just your Application's process by selecting it from the dropdown at the top
4. Look for any lines that include `Capgo` to find the SDK logs

Alternatively, you can use the `adb logcat` command and grep for `Capgo` to filter the logs.

The Capgo SDK will Journal key events during the Mise à jour process, such as:
- When an Mise à jour Vérifier is initiated
- If an Mise à jour is found and what Version it is
- When the Mise à jour Télécharger starts and completes
- When the Mise à jour Installation is triggered
- Any errors that occur during the Natif Mise à jour steps

Common Android-specific issues you might see in the Journaux include:
- Network connectivity problems preventing the Mise à jour Télécharger
- File permissions errors when saving or reading the Mise à jour Bundle
- Out of storage space for the Mise à jour Bundle
- Failure to Redémarrer the Application after the Mise à jour is installed

#### iOS Journaux

To access the iOS Journaux:

1. Connect your Appareil or Démarrer your simulator
2. Open Xcode and go to "Window > Appareils and Simulators"
3. Select your Appareil and click on "Open Console"
4. In the console output, look for any lines that include `Capgo` to find the SDK logs

You can also use the `log stream` command in the terminal and grep for `Capgo` to filter the logs.

Similar to Android, the Capgo SDK will Journal key iOS-side events:
- Mise à jour Vérifier initiation and result
- Télécharger Démarrer, progress, and completion
- Installation trigger and result
- Any errors during the Natif Mise à jour process

iOS-specific issues you might identify in the Journaux include:
- SSL certificate problems when downloading the Mise à jour
- Application transport Sécurité blocking the Mise à jour Télécharger 
- Insufficient storage space for the Mise à jour Bundle
- Failure to properly extract or apply the Mise à jour Bundle

On both platforms, the Natif Journaux provide a lower-level view into the Mise à jour process, with more details on the Natif implementation. They are especially useful for identifying issues that occur outside of the Capgo JavaScript layer.

When Dépannage a tricky live Mise à jour problem, it's a good idea to capture both the Capgo Débogage Journaux and the Natif Journaux for a comprehensive picture of what's happening. The two Journaux together will give you the best chance of identifying and resolving the Problème.

### Mises à jour not applying

If you've uploaded a Bundle but aren't seeing the changes on your Appareil:
- Make sure you've called `CapacitorUpdater.notifyAppReady()` in your app code as shown in the [quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quickstart)  
- Vérifier that your Appareil is connected to the internet and the Capgo Débogage Journaux show the Mise à jour was downloaded
- Try fully closing and reopening the Application, as Mises à jour are only applied on a fresh launch
- Look for any errors in the Natif Journaux that might indicate a problem applying the Mise à jour

Refer to the [deploying live updates](/docs/getting-started/deploy) guide for more details on the update process. If you're still stuck, use the `npx @capgo/cli@latest app debug` command and native logs to get more visibility into what's happening.

## SDK Installation

If you're having trouble installing the Capgo SDK, make sure:
- Your Application is using a supported Version of Capacitor (4.0 or newer)
- You've followed the [Démarrage rapide](/docs/getting-started/Démarrage rapide) steps in order, including syncing your Application after installing the SDK

## CI/CD Integration 

For issues with triggering Capgo uploads from your CI/CD pipeline:
- Double Vérifier your Capgo authentication token is set up correctly 
- Make sure you're running the Télécharger Commande after your web assets are built
- Vérifier that the Télécharger Commande is using the correct Canal name for your target environment

See the [CI/CD integration](/docs/getting-started/cicd-integration/) docs for more troubleshooting tips. You can also use the `npx @capgo/cli@latest app debug` command to confirm if your CI/CD-triggered updates are being received by the app.
