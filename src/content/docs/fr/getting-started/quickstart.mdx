<Steps>

1. Adding an Application to your Capgo Compte

2. Integrating Capgo with your CI/CD

3. Triggering Bundle Télécharger on Capgo by pushing commits 

4. Configuring and customizing the Capgo Bundle publishing

5. Setting up your Application to Activer Mises à jour en direct via Capgo

6. Deploying Mises à jour en direct to your Application from Capgo

</Steps>

Simply follow the Guide step-by-step, or navigate directly to the Documentation for the component that interests you.

The Over-the-Air (OTA) Mise à jour Fonctionnalité is applicable only for modifications made to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

If you make any changes to the Natif code, such as Mises à jour to Capacitor plugins, it is mandatory to resubmit the Application to the Application Store for approval.

## Store Guideline Compliance

Android Google Play and iOS Application Store have corresponding guidelines that have rules you should be aware of before integrating the Capacitor-updater Solution within your Application.

### Google Play

Third paragraph of [Appareil and Network Abuse](https://Support.google.com/googleplay/Android-developer/answer/9888379/?hl=en) topic describe that updating source code by any method other than Google Play's Mise à jour mechanism is restricted. But this restriction does not apply to updating javascript Bundles.
> This restriction does not apply to code that runs in a virtual machine and has limited access to Android APIs (such as JavaScript in a WebView or browser).

That fully allows Capacitor-updater as it Mises à jour just the JS Bundles and won't Mise à jour Natif code.

### Application Store

Paragraph **3.3.2**, since Retour in 2015's [Apple Developer Program Licence Agreement](https://developer.apple.com/programs/iOS/Information/) fully allows performing over-the-air Mises à jour of JavaScript and assets -  and in its latest Version (20170605) [downloadable here](https://developer.apple.com/terms/) this ruling is even broader:

> Interpreted code may be downloaded to an Application but only so long as such code: (a) does not change the primary purpose of the Application by providing Fonctionnalités or functionality that are inconsistent with the intended and advertised purpose of the Application as submitted to the Application Store, (b) does not Créer a store or storefront for other code or applications, and (c) does not bypass signing, sandbox, or other Sécurité Fonctionnalités of the OS.

Capacitor Updater allows you to follow these rules in full compliance so long as the Mise à jour you Pousser does not significantly deviate your product from its original Application Store approved intent.

To further remain in compliance with Apple's guidelines we suggest that App Store-distributed apps do not enable the `Force update` scenario, since in the [App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/) state that:

> Apps must not force Utilisateurs to rate the Application, review the Application, Télécharger other apps, or other similar actions in order to access functionality, content, or use of the Application.

This is not a problem for the default behavior of background Mise à jour, since it won't force the Utilisateur to apply the Nouveau Version until Suivant time they close the Application, but at least you should be aware of that role if you decide to show it.

## Open source

The plugin is under the LGPL-3.0 Licence and the Retour-end is AGPL-3.0 Licence.

> 💡 LGPL-3.0 means if someone modifies the code of the plugin, it’s mandatory to publish it, in open-source with the same licensing. If you use the code without modification, that doesn’t concern you. See the Problème below for more details Vérifier the link 👇

## Final Notes

If you self-host and find this tool useful, please consider supporting my work by becoming a [GitHub sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/riderx/).

I made a bet to open-source all the code I built here instead of paywalling it. By opening it up instead of fighting and hiding, I believe we can make the world a better place.

To make this possible, it's necessary for all of us to do our part, including you 🥹. If Capgo cloud doesn't meet your needs, you can Retour a bootstrapped Maker [here](https://github.com/sponsors/riderx/) on your own terms.

## Simple Maths

The price of the basic plan: $14*12 = $168 a year.
While average dev/hour = $60.
That means that 3 hours wasted of dev time on self-host allows you to pay for a whole year, if you spent more than 3 hours you're losing money ^^
