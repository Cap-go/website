This Documentation will explain how to run your own auto-Mise à jour server.

## Introduction

If you find this work helpful, please consider supporting my work by becoming a [Github sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/riderx).

I made a bet to open-source all the code I built here instead of paywalling it. By opening it up instead of fighting and hiding, I believe we can make the world a better place.

Furthermore, I want to focus on Capgo tooling, and make it an open and transparent business.

But to make it possible, it is necessary for all of us to do our part, including you 🥹.

If Capgo doesn't suit you, then pay your own price and [Retour a bootstrapped Maker](https://github.com/sponsors/riderx) on your terms.

## Fonctionnalités parity

If you choose to go with your own server, you will lose the 5-min Configuration flow.\
You need to implement all of these Fonctionnalités yourself.

:::danger
If you send a bad Mise à jour to your Utilisateurs you can and will break their Application.
:::

> Be mindful that you can't use the Capgo cloud and your server at the same time.



:::danger
The Over-the-Air (OTA) Mise à jour Fonctionnalité is applicable only for modifications made to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

If you make any changes to the Natif code, such as Mises à jour to Capacitor plugins, it is mandatory to resubmit the Application to the Application Store for approval.
:::

## Choose between Auto and Manual
In auto mode, part of the logic is handled by the Natif code, Mises à jour are decided server side, this is more secure and allows fine grain Mises à jour, partial Déploiement to one Appareil or group and more.

In manual mode, all the logic is handled by the JS.

## Installer Capacitor updater

```bash title="Install the Capacitor updater"
npm install @capgo/capacitor-updater
npx cap sync
```

## Prepare your Bundle

To send Mises à jour to your Application, you need to zip it.
The best way to be certain your zip is good is to use the Capgo CLI for zipping.
```bash title="Create a bundle with your files to serve from your server"
npx @capgo/cli@latest bundle zip
```


You will have to serve this zip from your server on your own.

:::Remarque
If this seems like a lot of work, try the trial Capgo Cloud.

:::Remarque
Differential Mise à jour will not work in manual Mises à jour, but it can work in auto Mise à jour, right now it's not documented as it's pretty complex process
