## Ionic live reload

* When you develop, if you use the Ionic live reload feature from the CLI, it will override the plugin, so you will never see your update.

## Quasar live reload

* It uses the same system as ionic under the hood, so you will not see your updates.

## Mises à jour fail

* This usually happens when large updates (> 20mb) are pushed, a big percentage of users will not get the last version.  
In the past, Utilisateurs needed to keep the Application open until the Télécharger was done, now we use background Télécharger, but it's still limited to a few seconds.

## Android

### Cannot Télécharger

We have seen some issues with Appareils in india, and got Utilisateur on the call, made them try different DNS servers, and it worked.

So if you have the Problème, try to use a different DNS server like Cloudflare or Google DNS.

Cloudflare: 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1

Google DNS: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 or dns.google

### Self Hosted
When you are pushing a self-hosted Mise à jour, be mindful you cannot use "HTTP" endpoint as it's against the Sécurité policies of Android apps, if you still want to do it, follow this Guide:

### Unzip 

Unzip Problème: DEFLATED entries can have EXT descriptor

If you zipped your bundle with something different than the CLI, the format or your zip could be incorrect, please use the CLI command `npx @capgo/cli zip BUNDLE_FOLDER`.

This is a known Problème of Java:

### Clearfix Problème

* If you have issues with usesCleartextTraffic, it's because the plugin follows the good practice recommended by sonar cloud, in 90% of the cases it will work just fine, but with some plugins that causes issues.

To fix it, add in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` in the `<application>` key :

```xml
tools:replace="android:usesCleartextTraffic"
xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
```

## iOS

### Privacy manifest

Add the `NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategoryUserDefaults` dictionary key to your [Privacy Manifest](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/ios/privacy-manifest) (usually `ios/App/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypes</key>
    <array>
      <!-- Add this dict entry to the array if the file already exists. -->
      <dict>
        <key>NSPrivacyAccessedAPIType</key>
        <string>NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategoryUserDefaults</string>
        <key>NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypeReasons</key>
        <array>
          <string>CA92.1</string>
        </array>
      </dict>
    </array>
  </dict>
</plist>
```

We recommend to declare [`CA92.1`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_use_of_required_reason_api#4278401) as the reason for accessing the [`UserDefaults`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults) API.


### Network permissions

When using local server for Test Mise à jour, the Application will ask for network permission, it's a normal behavior, it's not the case when you use a remote server.


## Both OS

When doing manual mode Mises à jour, some events are not easy to catch, for Exemple the Mise à jour fail triggers just before your JS code reloads, so you will not be able to catch it.

One alternative is to list the Bundles and Vérifier Erreur stats to know if the Mise à jour fails.

We need to find a better way to handle this in the future, but it's not a priority, since auto mode is the recommended way to do Mise à jour.

PRs are welcome to Aide us improve this.

## CLI

if your CLI has troubles doing anything,

Vérifier if **appId** and **appName** are present in your **capacitor.config.ts**

Follow the Guide of the official doc:
