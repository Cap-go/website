## What this Tutoriel will cover?

This Tutoriel will show how to use capacitor updater in a dev environment with self hosted capgo

## Requirements

 1. [Cloned capgo](https://github.com/Cap-go/capgo)

## Commencer

To use the capacitor updater with self-hosted capgo edit the `capacitor.config.ts` from your app directory and set it like this:

```ts
const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  appId: 'com.demo.app',
  appName: 'demoApp',
  webDir: 'dist',
  bundledWebRuntime: false,
  plugins: {
    CapacitorUpdater : {
      statsUrl: "https://localhost:54321/functions/v1/stats",
      channelUrl: "https://localhost:54321/functions/v1/channel_self",
      updateUrl: "https://localhost:54321/functions/v1/updates"
    },
  },
};
```

This will Activer you to use local capgo in Développement. However, by default, this is not enough.

> By default both iOS and Android expect you to use HTTPS, you need to use a tool like Ngrock or localcan to proxy your API in https.

There is a way in Android to Activer [plaintext communication](https://developer.Android.com/topic/Sécurité/risks/cleartext).
This can be achieved by modifying [AndroidManifest.xml](https://github.com/Cap-go/capacitor-updater/blob/main/android/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml) and adding `android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"` in the `application` tag
A full Exemple of this change can be seen [here](https://gist.github.com/WcaleNieWolny/061a015acdebe35eaf3afd7030797701)

There also could be a problem that prevents the Android Application from connecting. If you do not see any requests being send to edge functions run
```bash
adb reverse tcp:54321 tcp:54321
```
