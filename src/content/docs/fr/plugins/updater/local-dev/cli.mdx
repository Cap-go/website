## What this Tutoriel will cover?

This Tutoriel will show how to use CLI in a dev environment with self hosted capgo

## Commencer

To use the CLI with self-hosted capgo edit the `capacitor.config.ts` from your app directory and set it like this:

```ts
const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  appId: 'com.demo.app',
  appName: 'demoApp',
  webDir: 'dist',
  bundledWebRuntime: false,
  plugins: {
    CapacitorUpdater : {
      localHost: "http://localhost:5173",
      localWebHost: "http://localhost:5173",
      localSupa: "http://localhost:54321",
      localSupaAnon: "see_notes",
    },
  },
};
```

Note: To get `localSupaAnon` please follow [this tutorial](/docs/plugin/self-hosted/local-dev/getting-started/) and copy the `anon key` into `localSupaAnon`
