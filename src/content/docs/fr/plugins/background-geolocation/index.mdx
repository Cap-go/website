## Plugin comparison

A short comparison between the three main background-geolocation plugins commonly used in Capacitor apps.

| Plugin | Accuracy | Background | HTTP Télécharger | Pricing |
|--------|----------|------------|-------------|---------|
| `@capacitor-community/background-geolocation` (Community) | Not accurate | Yes | No | Free |
| `@capgo/background-geolocation` (this plugin) | Accurate | Yes | No | Free |
| Transistorsoft (original) | Accurate | Yes | Yes — built-in HTTP uploader to your API | Paid |

**Notes:**
- The Communauté plugin is lightweight and continues to work in the background, but it is known to be less accurate than the Options below.
- This Capgo plugin is optimized to provide accurate location fixes and reliable background operation without requiring a paid Licence.
- Transistorsoft offers a Terminé commercial Solution that also includes built-in HTTP Télécharger capabilities for sending location data to your backend.
