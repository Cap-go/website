## Using in Your Application

The Natif-purchases plugin automatically handles introductory offer eligibility and presentation:

```typescript
import { NativePurchases, PURCHASE_TYPE } from '@capgo/native-purchases';

// Fetch products (includes intro offer metadata)
const { products } = await NativePurchases.getProducts({
  productIdentifiers: ['com.example.premium.monthly'],
  productType: PURCHASE_TYPE.SUBS,
});

const product = products[0];

if (product.introductoryPrice) {
  console.log(`Intro price: ${product.introductoryPriceString}`);
  console.log(`Regular price: ${product.priceString}`);
  console.log(
    `Offer duration: ${product.introductoryPrice.subscriptionPeriod?.numberOfUnits} ${product.introductoryPrice.subscriptionPeriod?.unit}`,
  );
} else {
  console.log('No intro offer configured for this product');
}

// Purchase (Google Play applies intro pricing automatically if the user is eligible)
const transaction = await NativePurchases.purchaseProduct({
  productIdentifier: 'com.example.premium.monthly',
  planIdentifier: 'monthly-plan', // Base Plan ID from Google Play Console
  productType: PURCHASE_TYPE.SUBS,
});

console.log('Introductory purchase transaction', transaction.transactionId);
```

## Best Practices

### Offer Duration
- **Free trials**: 3-14 days is optimal for most apps
- **Discounted periods**: 1-3 months works well for Construction habit
- **Price discount**: 50-70% off regular price drives conversions

### Marketing
- Clearly display the intro offer and regular price
- Show what happens after the intro period
- Make cancellation easy and transparent
- Remind Utilisateurs before the intro period ends

### A/B Test
Test different offer structures:
- Free trial length
- Discount percentage
- Discount duration
- Single phase vs. multi-phase

## Important Notes

- Only one introductory offer can be Actif per subscription at a time
- Utilisateurs can only claim an intro offer once per subscription
- Intro offers don't apply to subscription upgrades/downgrades
- Changes to intro offers don't affect existing subscribers

## Dépannage

**Intro offer not showing:**
- Verify the offer is activated in Play Console
- Vérifier Utilisateur eligibility (may have used offer before)
- Ensure Application is using latest product Information

**Wrong users receiving offer:**
- Review eligibility Paramètres (Nouveau vs. existing customers)
- Vérifier if Utilisateur previously subscribed on different Appareil
- Verify Play Store Compte history

**Offer not applying at purchase:**
- Confirm product ID matches exactly
- Vérifier that offer is still Actif and not expired
- Verify date range Paramètres for the offer
