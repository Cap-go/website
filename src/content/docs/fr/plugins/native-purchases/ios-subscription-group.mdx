Subscription groups are essential for organizing and managing multiple subscription levels in your iOS Application. Understanding how they work is crucial for implementing Mise à niveau, downgrade, and crossgrade functionality.

## What is a Subscription Group?

A subscription group is a collection of related subscriptions that Utilisateurs can choose between. Utilisateurs can only subscribe to one subscription within a group at a time. When they switch subscriptions, Apple handles the transition automatically.

## Why Subscription Groups Matter

Subscription groups Activer:
- **Tiered pricing**: Offer basic, premium, and ultimate plans
- **Different durations**: Monthly, yearly, and lifetime Options
- **Mise à niveau/downgrade logic**: Automatic handling of subscription changes
- **Simplified management**: Group related subscriptions together

## Subscription Levels

Within a group, each subscription should be ranked from highest value (level 1) to lowest value. This ranking determines how subscription changes are classified:

![Subscription group hierarchy](/Natif-purchases/iOS/subscription-group/subscription-group-hierarchy.webp)

### Level Exemples

**Level 1** (Highest Value)
- Premium Annual ($99.99/year)
- Ultimate Monthly ($19.99/month)

**Level 2** (Medium Value)
- Standard Annual ($49.99/year)
- Premium Monthly ($9.99/month)

**Level 3** (Lowest Value)
- Basic Annual ($29.99/year)
- Standard Monthly ($4.99/month)

## Subscription Change Types

Apple automatically handles three types of subscription changes based on the level ranking:

### 1. Mise à niveau
Moving to a **higher-tier** subscription (e.g., level 2 → level 1).

**Behavior:**
- Takes effect **immediately**
- Utilisateur receives **prorated refund** for remaining time
- Nouveau subscription starts right away

**Example:**
```typescript
// User currently has: Standard Monthly (Level 2)
// User upgrades to: Premium Annual (Level 1)
// Result: Immediate access to Premium, refund for unused Standard time
```

### 2. Downgrade
Moving to a **lower-tier** subscription (e.g., level 1 → level 2).

**Behavior:**
- Takes effect at **Suivant renewal date**
- Utilisateur keeps current subscription until period ends
- Nouveau subscription starts automatically after expiration

**Example:**
```typescript
// User currently has: Premium Annual (Level 1)
// User downgrades to: Standard Monthly (Level 2)
// Result: Premium access continues until annual renewal date, then switches
```

### 3. Crossgrade
Switching to another subscription **at the same tier level**.

**Behavior depends on duration:**

**Different Duration** → Behaves like **downgrade**
- Takes effect at Suivant renewal date
- Exemple: Monthly Premium (Level 1) → Annual Premium (Level 1)

**Same Duration** → Behaves like **upgrade**
- Takes effect immediately
- Exemple: Premium Monthly (Level 1) → Ultimate Monthly (Level 1)

## Creating a Subscription Group

<Steps>

1. **Navigate to Subscriptions**

   In Application Store Connect, select your Application and go to **Monetize > Subscriptions**.

2. **Créer Group**

   Click **+** Suivant to "Subscription Groups" to Créer a Nouveau group.

3. **Name the Group**

   Choose a descriptive name that reflects the subscriptions it contains:
   - "Premium Access"
   - "Cloud Storage Plans"
   - "Pro Fonctionnalités"

4. **Ajouter Subscriptions**

   After creating the group, Ajouter individual subscriptions to it. Each subscription will have a level ranking.

5. **Set Level Rankings**

   Arrange subscriptions from highest value (1) to lowest value. Consider:
   - Annual plans typically rank higher than monthly
   - Higher-priced tiers rank above lower-priced ones
   - Ultimate/premium tiers rank highest

</Steps>

## Using in Your Application

The Natif-purchases plugin automatically handles subscription group logic:

```typescript
import { NativePurchases, PURCHASE_TYPE } from '@capgo/native-purchases';

// Fetch all subscriptions in a group
const { products } = await NativePurchases.getProducts({
  productIdentifiers: ['premium_monthly', 'premium_annual', 'ultimate_monthly'],
  productType: PURCHASE_TYPE.SUBS,
});

// Display current subscription using StoreKit transactions
const { purchases } = await NativePurchases.getPurchases({
  productType: PURCHASE_TYPE.SUBS,
});

const activeSubs = purchases.filter((purchase) => purchase.isActive);

// Detect pending downgrade/cancellation (StoreKit sets willCancel === true)
const pendingChange = purchases.find((purchase) => purchase.willCancel === true);
if (pendingChange) {
  console.log('Subscription will stop auto-renewing on', pendingChange.expirationDate);
}

// Purchase (StoreKit handles upgrades/downgrades automatically)
await NativePurchases.purchaseProduct({
  productIdentifier: 'premium_annual',
  productType: PURCHASE_TYPE.SUBS,
});

// Listen for StoreKit updates (fires on upgrades/downgrades/refunds)
NativePurchases.addListener('transactionUpdated', (transaction) => {
  console.log('Subscription updated:', transaction);
});
```

## Handling Subscription Changes

### Detecting Change Type

```typescript
import { NativePurchases, PURCHASE_TYPE } from '@capgo/native-purchases';

// Get current subscription info
const { purchases } = await NativePurchases.getPurchases({
  productType: PURCHASE_TYPE.SUBS,
});

const currentSubscription = purchases.find(
  (purchase) => purchase.subscriptionState === 'subscribed',
);

if (currentSubscription) {
  // StoreKit reports if user cancelled auto-renew
  if (currentSubscription.willCancel) {
    console.log(
      `User cancelled. Access remains until ${currentSubscription.expirationDate}`,
    );
  }

  if (currentSubscription.isUpgraded) {
    console.log('User recently upgraded to this plan.');
  }
}

// Listen for automatic upgrades/downgrades
NativePurchases.addListener('transactionUpdated', (transaction) => {
  console.log('Subscription changed!', transaction);
  if (transaction.subscriptionState === 'revoked') {
    revokeAccess();
  } else if (transaction.isActive) {
    unlockPremiumFeatures();
  }
});
```

### Utilisateur Communication

Always communicate the change behavior clearly:

**For Upgrades:**
> "You'll get immediate access to Premium Fonctionnalités. We'll prorate your current subscription."

**For Downgrades:**
> "You'll keep Premium access until [renewal date], then switch to Standard."

**For Crossgrades:**
> "Your plan will change to Annual billing at the Suivant renewal on [date]."

## Server monitoring

Use Apple's App Store Server Notifications v2 or your own receipt-validation backend to mirror StoreKit changes in your database. Pair server notifications with the `transactionUpdated` listener so both client and backend stay in sync.

## Best Practices

### Group Organisation
- Keep related subscriptions in the same group
- Don't mix unrelated Fonctionnalités (e.g., storage and ad removal)
- Créer separate groups for different Fonctionnalité sets

### Level Ranking Strategy
- Annual plans → Higher level than monthly (for same tier)
- Higher-priced tiers → Higher level
- Consider value, not just price

### Utilisateur Experience
- Show current subscription clearly
- Display all Disponible Options in the group
- Indicate which changes are immediate vs. at renewal
- Allow easy switching between plans

### Test
- Test all Mise à niveau scenarios
- Test all downgrade scenarios
- Verify crossgrade behavior
- Vérifier webhook firing

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Three-Tier Monthly Plans
```
Level 1: Ultimate Monthly ($19.99)
Level 2: Premium Monthly ($9.99)
Level 3: Basic Monthly ($4.99)
```

- Basic → Premium: Mise à niveau (immediate)
- Premium → Ultimate: Mise à niveau (immediate)
- Ultimate → Premium: Downgrade (at renewal)
- Basic → Ultimate: Mise à niveau (immediate)

### Scenario 2: Mixed Duration Plans
```
Level 1: Premium Annual ($99.99/year)
Level 2: Premium Monthly ($9.99/month)
```

- Monthly → Annual: Crossgrade (at renewal)
- Annual → Monthly: Downgrade (at renewal)

### Scenario 3: Multi-Tier Multi-Duration
```
Level 1: Ultimate Annual ($199/year)
Level 2: Ultimate Monthly ($19.99/month)
Level 3: Premium Annual ($99/year)
Level 4: Premium Monthly ($9.99/month)
Level 5: Basic Annual ($49/year)
Level 6: Basic Monthly ($4.99/month)
```

This Configuration provides maximum flexibility while maintaining clear Mise à niveau/downgrade logic.

## Dépannage

**Subscription not appearing in group:**
- Verify it's assigned to the correct group
- Vérifier that it's in at least "Ready to Soumettre" status
- Ensure product ID is correct

**Wrong upgrade/downgrade behavior:**
- Review level rankings (1 = highest)
- Verify subscription tiers make sense
- Vérifier that levels are set correctly

**Products from different groups:**
- Utilisateurs can subscribe to multiple groups simultaneously
- This is intentional - keep related products in same group

**getActiveProducts showing multiple subscriptions:**
- Vérifier if subscriptions are in different groups
- Verify Utilisateur isn't subscribed via Family Sharing
- Review subscription status in Application Store Connect
