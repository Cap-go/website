Use Capgo's Mises à jour en direct Fonctionnalité to Mise à jour the JavaScript Bundles of your Application remotely, in real-time. Pousser JS Mises à jour directly to your Utilisateurs without going through the Application Store review process to instantly fix bugs and ship Nouveau Fonctionnalités.

<Aside>

Mises à jour en direct are limited to JavaScript Bundle changes. If you need to Mise à jour Natif code, such as adding or removing a plugin or changing Natif project Configuration, you'll need to Soumettre a Nouveau Natif binary Construction to the Application stores.

## How Mises à jour en direct Work

Capgo's Live Mise à jour system has two key components:

1. The Capgo SDK, which you Installer in your Application. The SDK checks for Disponible Mises à jour and downloads them in the background.

2. Channels, which let you target updates to specific groups of users. You can use channels to manage different release tracks, such as `Production`, `Staging`, and `Dev`.

When you Télécharger a Nouveau JS Bundle to Capgo and assign it to a Canal, the Capgo SDK in apps configured for that Canal will detect the Mise à jour and Télécharger it. The Suivant time the Application restarts, the Nouveau Bundle will be loaded.

## Commencer

To Démarrer using Mises à jour en direct, follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. Terminé the [Capgo Démarrage rapide](/docs/getting-started/Démarrage rapide) to set up your Application in Capgo and Installer the Capgo SDK.

2. In your app code, call `CapacitorUpdater.notifyAppReady()` after your app has finished initializing. This tells the Capgo SDK that your app is ready to receive updates.

3. Construction your JS Bundle and Télécharger it to Capgo:
   ```shell
   npm run build
   npx @capgo/cli@latest bundle upload --channel=production 
   ```

4. Open your Application and wait for the Mise à jour to Télécharger. You can Vérifier the status with:
   ```shell
   npx @capgo/cli@latest app debug
   ```

5. Once the Mise à jour is downloaded, close and reopen your Application to load the Nouveau Bundle.

</Steps>

See the [Deploying Mises à jour en direct](/docs/getting-started/Déployer) Guide for more details.

## The Capgo CLI

The Capgo CLI is a powerful tool that allows developers to interact with Capgo's services from their own CI/CD pipelines. With the CLI, you have granular control over when builds are produced and deployed, enabling you to integrate Capgo into your existing Entreprise workflows.

### What is the Capgo CLI for?

The Capgo CLI is designed for developers and teams who need more control and flexibility in their live Mise à jour workflows. By using the CLI in your CI/CD pipelines, you can:

- Decide exactly when to Construction and Déployer Mises à jour, rather than relying on Capgo's built-in automation
- Insert your own processes, such as code signing, QA Test, or manager approvals, between the Construction and Déployer steps
- Integrate Capgo into your existing DevOps tooling and workflows

### Authentication

To use the Capgo CLI, you'll need to authenticate with your Clé API. You can generate an Clé API in your Capgo Compte Paramètres.

To Journal in and securely store your Clé API, run:

```shell
npx @capgo/cli@latest login [API_KEY]
```

This Commande will then be saved for future use. You won't need to provide your Clé API with each Commande after logging in.

### Key Differences from Other CLI Tools

If you're familiar with other live Mise à jour CLI tools, there are a few key things to Remarque À propos Capgo's CLI:

- Capgo uses a single CLI for both Développement and CI/CD use cases, as Capgo is focused solely on the live Mise à jour Fonctionnalité set.

- The Capgo CLI doesn't require a separate installation step. It's bundled with the `@capgo/cli` package and can be run directly using `npx`.

- Capgo's CLI is designed specifically for the live Mise à jour workflow, so it may not include some Fonctionnalités or Commandes found in more general-purpose CLI tools.
