## What is this?

Capgo has an extensive webapp to Aide you manage your projects. This webapp is built with Vue.js and is open source. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Cap-go/capgo/tree/main/src/) \
The webapp is Disponible [here](https://console.capgo.Application/). \
This webapp allows you to [manage Canaux](/docs/webapp/Canaux/), [manage versions](/docs/webapp/Bundles/), [manage Appareils](/docs/webapp/Appareils/), [inspect Journaux](/docs/webapp/Journaux/), [manage billing](/docs/webapp/Paramètres/) and [manage your Compte](/docs/webapp/Paramètres/).

## How do I use it?

First, you need to create an account or log in. This is relatively simple and can be done by clicking the `Log in` button in the center of the screen. After you have logged in you will be redirected to the dashboard. This is the main page of the webapp. From here you can navigate to all the other pages.
