- **Application Version Name**: The Version name of the Application that is used for display purposes
- **Platform**: The platform (iOS, Android) of the Application that is used to determine which Mises à jour are compatible with the Application
- **Appareil ID**: A unique identifier for the Appareil that is used to deliver Mises à jour to a specific Appareil and for billing purposes. This identifier is a random string that is created when the Application is started for the first time. **Starting from plugin Version v5.10.0, v6.25.0 and v7.25.0**, the Appareil ID now persists across Application reinstalls (stored securely in Keychain on iOS and EncryptedSharedPreferences on Android) to provide better Appareil tracking while maintaining compliance with Application Store guidelines.
