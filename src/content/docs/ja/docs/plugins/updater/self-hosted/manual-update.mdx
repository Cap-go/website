## Configuration

Add this to your ``capacitor.config.json``, to disable auto-update.
```tsx
// capacitor.config.json
{
	"appId": "**.***.**",
	"appName": "Name",
	"plugins": {
		"CapacitorUpdater": {
			"autoUpdate": false,
		}
	}
}
```

## Usage

You can use this example or re-create the logic in your app.

:::caution
We are forcing the user to update the app with a static version declared in the code. This is not recommended, you should use a dynamic version from your server.
:::

:::danger
We are not doing any version checking, decryption or checksum validation in this example. You should do that on your own.
:::

```tsx
import { CapacitorUpdater } from '@capgo/capacitor-updater'
import { SplashScreen } from '@capacitor/splash-screen'
import { App } from '@capacitor/app'
let data = {version: ""}
CapacitorUpdater.notifyAppReady()
App.addListener('appStateChange', async(state) => {
     if (state.isActive) {
       // Do the download during user active app time to prevent failed download
       data = await CapacitorUpdater.download({
       version: '0.0.4',
       url: 'https://github.com/Cap-go/demo-app/releases/download/0.0.4/dist.zip',
       })
     }
     if (!state.isActive && data.version !== "") {
       // Do the switch when user leave app
       SplashScreen.show()
       try {
         await CapacitorUpdater.set(data)
       } catch (err) {
         console.log(err)
         SplashScreen.hide() // in case the set fail, otherwise the new app will have to hide it
       }
     }
 })
```
