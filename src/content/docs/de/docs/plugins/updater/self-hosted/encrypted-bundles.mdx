## End-to-end Encryption

Starting with version 4.15.0 the plugin allows you to send encrypted updates.

### Step 1: Create a private key
```bash title='Create a private key'
npx @capgo/cli key create
```

### Step 2: Create and zip your bundle
```bash title="Create bundle zip with checksum"
npx @capgo/cli bundle zip [appId] --key-v2 --json
```

The `--key-v2` flag uses the new encryption system with better checksums, and the `--json` flag will output the bundle information including the checksum that you'll need for encryption.

### Step 3: Encrypt your bundle
```bash title="Encrypt bundled zip with checksum"
npx @capgo/cli encrypt [path/to/zip] [checksum]
```

The `checksum` parameter is the SHA256 checksum generated by the zip command in step 2. The encrypt command will return an `ivSessionKey` and generate an encrypted checksum.Remember to rename `ivSessionKey` key as `session_key` in the update payload.

### Step 4: Use in your update payload
```json
{
"version": "1.2.3",
"url": "https://myserver.com/app/updates/my-new-app-2.0.0.zip",
"session_key": "encrypted_session_key",
"checksum": "encrypted_checksum_from_encrypt_command"
}
```

The `session_key` is the `ivSessionKey` returned by the encrypt command, and the `checksum` is the encrypted checksum generated during encryption (not the original checksum from the zip command).

Then your app will be able to use the private key to decrypt the `session_key` and use the decrypted `session_key` to decrypt the update. The encrypted checksum ensures bundle integrity verification.
