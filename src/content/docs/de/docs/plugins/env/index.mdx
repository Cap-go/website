Capgo Env lets you store secrets and per-build configuration inside `capacitor.config.*` and resolve them at runtime through a simple API.

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Runtime configuration" icon="rocket">
    Read values from native config files without shipping them in your JavaScript bundle.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Per build overrides" icon="rocket">
    Create multiple app flavors or tenants by providing different config files.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Typesafe access" icon="pencil">
    Fetch keys with TypeScript support and centralize fallback logic.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secure by default" icon="approve-check">
    Keep API keys and secrets out of Git while still shipping them with native binaries.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

Follow the getting started guide to declare keys in your Capacitor config and fetch them safely across platforms.
