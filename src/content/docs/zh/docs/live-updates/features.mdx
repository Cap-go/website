本页面提供了Capgo Live Updates中所有可用功能的全面概述。每个功能都包含简要说明和详细文档的链接。

## Core Update System

### Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates
Deploy JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and asset updates directly to users without app store approval. Updates are downloaded in the background and applied on next app restart.

- No user interruption
- Cross-platform support (iOS, Android, Electron)

[Learn more about update behavior →](/docs/live-updates/update-behavior/)

---

### Delta Updates (Differential Updates)
Only download files that have changed between versions, reducing bandwidth usage by up to 95% and speeding up update delivery.

**Key capabilities:**
- Automatic file-level diffing
- Checksum-based verification
- Manifest comparison
- Intelligent fallback to full updates when needed

[Learn more about delta updates →](/docs/live-updates/differentials/)

---

### Automatic Rollback
If an update fails to load or causes crashes, the system automatically reverts to the last known working version.

**Key capabilities:**
- Crash detection
- Timeout detection

[Learn more about rollbacks →](/docs/live-updates/rollbacks/)

---

### Checksum Validation & Fallback
