## What does the main page shows?

First, let's take a look at the main page:
<figure><img src="/main-page.webp" alt="Main page screenshot" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Let's start at the beginning. The first thing you see is the **stats**. It contains app-specific statistics. Those updates depend on the usage of the app

The second thing you see is the list of all available apps. This will change depending on how many apps have you created. You can click on each app to see more details about it.

The third thing you see is the **API keys** button. This button will take you to the [API keys](/docs/webapp/api-keys/) page.

The next thing you see is the **test Capgo** button. This button will change depending on your first and second name and it will take you to the [settings](/docs/webapp/settings/) or support page.

Lastly, you see a button to add another app. This button will take you to a page where you can add a new app to capgo.
