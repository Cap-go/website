API keys are used to authenticate requests to the Capgo API. Each key can have different permissions (modes) to control access levels. Keys are organization-specific and should be managed carefully as they grant access to your Capgo resources.

## Key Modes

- **read**: Can only read data, no modifications allowed
- **upload**: Can read, modify, and upload new bundles
- **write**: Can read, modify data, and upload bundles
- **all**: Full access to all operations

Key modes follow a stepped/gradual schema. If you have an upload key, and then you create a write key, the write key will be able to do everything that the upload key could.
Please take a look at the following diagram to better understand how API keys work.

## Subkeys with Limited Rights

You can create subkeys with limited access to specific apps or organizations. This is useful for restricting access to certain resources while still allowing operations on others. Use the `limited_to_apps` and `limited_to_orgs` parameters when creating a key to define these restrictions.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Always use the most restrictive mode that still allows your integration to function
2. **Regular Rotation**: Rotate your API keys periodically
3. **Secure Storage**: Store API keys securely and never commit them to version control
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor API key usage and revoke any compromised keys immediately
5. **Limited Subkeys**: Use subkeys with limited rights for specific integrations to minimize risk

## Endpoints

### GET

`https://api.capgo.app/apikey/`

Retrieve all API keys associated with your account.

#### Response Type

```typescript
interface ApiKey {
  created_at: string | null
  id: number
  key: string
  mode: 'read' | 'write' | 'upload' | 'all'
  name: string
  updated_at: string | null
  user_id: string
  limited_to_apps?: string[]
  limited_to_orgs?: string[]
}
```

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -H "authorization: your-api-key" https://api.capgo.app/apikey/
```

#### Example Response

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "key": "ak_123...",
      "mode": "read",
      "name": "CI/CD Read Key",
      "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "user_id": "user_123"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "key": "ak_456...",
      "mode": "upload",
      "name": "Deploy Bot",
      "created_at": "2024-01-02T00:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-01-02T00:00:00Z",
      "user_id": "user_123",
      "limited_to_apps": ["com.demo.app"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### POST

`https://api.capgo.app/apikey/`

Create a new API key for a specific organization.

#### Query Parameters

```typescript
interface ApiKeyCreate {
  name: string
  mode: 'read' | 'write' | 'upload' | 'all'
  limited_to_apps?: string[]
  limited_to_orgs?: string[]
}
```

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "authorization: your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Limited Read Key",
    "mode": "read",
    "limited_to_apps": ["com.demo.app"]
  }' \
  https://api.capgo.app/apikey/
```

#### Example Response

```json
{
  "apikey": {
    "id": 3,
    "key": "ak_789...",
    "mode": "read",
    "name": "Limited Read Key",
    "created_at": "2024-02-12T00:00:00Z",
    "user_id": "user_123",
    "limited_to_apps": ["com.demo.app"]
  }
}
```

### DELETE

`https://api.capgo.app/apikey/:id/`

Delete an existing API key. Use this to revoke access immediately.

#### Parameters
- `id`: The ID of the API key to delete (numeric identifier, not the key string itself)

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -X DELETE -H "authorization: your-api-key" https://api.capgo.app/apikey/1/
```

#### Success Response

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

## Common Use Cases

1. **CI/CD Integration**: Create read-only keys for CI pipelines to check deployment status
2. **Deployment Automation**: Use upload mode keys for automated deployment scripts
3. **Monitoring Tools**: Use read mode keys for external monitoring integrations
4. **Admin Access**: Use all mode keys sparingly for administrative tools
5. **Limited Access**: Create subkeys with limited rights to specific apps or organizations for third-party integrations

## Error Handling

Common error scenarios and their responses:

```json
// Invalid mode
{
  "error": "Invalid mode specified. Must be one of: read, write, upload, all",
  "status": "KO"
}

// Key not found
{
  "error": "API key not found",
  "status": "KO"
}

// Permission denied
{
  "error": "Insufficient permissions to manage API keys",
  "status": "KO"
}
```
