Let's break down what you are going to need in order to setup Apple login on IOS.

<Steps>
1. Configure the capabilities of your app.

    In order to do this, please open Xcode, click on `App`

2. Make sure that you select the right target.

3. Please make sure that you add the `Sign in with Apple` capability.

    :::caution
    If you don't see the `Sign in with Apple` capability, configure the [Account & Organizational Data Sharing](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/services/cwa/configure/)
    :::

4. Initialize the Apple Login in your app.

    :::note
    I am using Vue as my framework, the exact implementation will vary depending on the framework of your choice
    :::

    ```ts
    //  onMounted is vue specific
    onMounted(() => {
    SocialLogin.initialize({
        apple: {}
    })
    });
    ```

5. Create a button that will begin the login process.

    Said button should call the following function:

    ```ts
    async function loginApple() {
    const res = await SocialLogin.login({
        provider: 'apple',
        options: {}
    })
    ```

6. Run your app on a **<u>PHYSICAL</u>** device and test it. 

    If you followed the steps closely you will see the following screen after clicking your button.

</Steps>

That's it! You are all set.
