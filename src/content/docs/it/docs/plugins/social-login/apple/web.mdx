Configuring the web login is not trivial. It's more difficult than setting up `Sign in with Apple` on iOS but more difficult than setting up `Sign in with Apple` on Android.

## Generating the service

:::note
This step is redundant if you have already configured `Sign in with Apple` on Android.
:::

Please follow the guide [here](/docs/plugins/social-login/apple/android/#creating-the-service-id/) to generate the service.

## Configuring the `Return URLs`

<Steps>

1. **Go to your Service ID configuration**
   
   In the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com), navigate to `Identifiers` > `Services IDs` and click on your service ID.

2. **Configure Sign in with Apple**
   
   Click on `Configure` next to `Sign in with Apple`.

4. **Add the Return URLs**

   Add your domain for your web application in `Domains and Subdomains`.
   :::caution
   You **CANNOT** add `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as a domain here.
   :::

   Then, add your domain with the `https://` prefix and the path from which you will call Apple Login.
   For example, if your domain is `https://my-app.com` and you will call Apple Login from `/login`, you should add `https://my-app.com/login` as the return URL.

   :::caution
   You **MUST** add both the domain with a trailing slash and without a trailing slash.

5. **Save the changes**

   1. Click on the `Next` button to save the changes.
   2. Click on the `Save` button to save the changes.

6. You should be ready to test the login for JavaScript. Please note that you cannot test from localhost.
