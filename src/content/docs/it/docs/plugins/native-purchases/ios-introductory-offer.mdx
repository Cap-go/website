Introductory offers allow you to provide eligible users with free trials or discounted introductory pricing to reduce barriers to entry and increase subscription conversions.

## Overview

Introductory offers are one of the most effective tools for growing your subscriber base. They allow users to:
- Try your premium features risk-free
- Experience value before committing
- Start at a lower price point
- Build confidence in your product

## Offer Types

iOS supports three types of introductory offers:

### 1. Free Trial
Customers get complimentary access for a specified duration. After the trial, they're charged at standard rates if they don't cancel.

**Examples:**
- 7 days free
- 14 days free
- 1 month free

**Best for:**
- High-value subscriptions
- Feature-rich apps
- Building user habit

### 2. Pay Up Front
Customers pay a single discounted price that covers the introductory period.

**Examples:**
- $1.99 for 2 months (then $9.99/month)
- $9.99 for 3 months (then $19.99/month)

**Best for:**
- Commitment signals
- Cash flow needs
- Testing price sensitivity

### 3. Pay As You Go
Customers pay a reduced price for multiple billing cycles.

**Examples:**
- $1.99/month for 3 months (then $9.99/month)
- $4.99/month for 6 months (then $14.99/month)

**Best for:**
- Gradual commitment
- Long-term value demonstration
- Reducing perceived risk

## Eligibility Requirements

Users can only receive introductory offers if they:
- Haven't previously received an introductory offer for the product
- Haven't received an introductory offer for any product in the same subscription group
- Haven't had an active subscription to the product

:::note
Apple handles eligibility checking automatically. The native-purchases plugin provides methods to check eligibility before presenting offers.

## Using in Your App

The native-purchases plugin automatically handles introductory offer presentation and eligibility:

```typescript
import { NativePurchases, PURCHASE_TYPE } from '@capgo/native-purchases';

// Fetch products with intro offer information
const { products } = await NativePurchases.getProducts({
  productIdentifiers: ['com.yourapp.premium_monthly'],
  productType: PURCHASE_TYPE.SUBS,
});

const product = products[0];

// Display intro offer details (StoreKit sends localized metadata)
if (product.introductoryPrice) {
  console.log('Intro price:', product.introductoryPriceString);
  console.log('Intro period:', product.introductoryPricePeriod);
  console.log('Intro cycles:', product.introductoryPriceCycles);
  console.log('Regular price:', product.priceString);
} else {
  console.log('No intro offer configured');
}

// Purchase (StoreKit automatically applies intro pricing if eligible)
try {
  const transaction = await NativePurchases.purchaseProduct({
    productIdentifier: 'com.yourapp.premium_monthly',
    productType: PURCHASE_TYPE.SUBS,
  });

  console.log('Subscription active, receipt length:', transaction.receipt?.length);
  await validateReceiptOnServer(transaction.receipt);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Purchase failed:', error);
}
```

## Displaying Intro Offers to Users

### Best Practices for UI

**Clear Value Proposition:**
```
Try Premium Free for 7 Days
Then $9.99/month. Cancel anytime.
```

**Emphasize Savings:**
```
Start at Just $1.99
Get 3 months of Premium for only $1.99
Then $9.99/month
```

**Transparent Communication:**
```
Your Free Trial
• Access all premium features
• No charge for 7 days
• $9.99/month after trial
• Cancel anytime, even during trial
```

### Example Implementation

```typescript
function formatIntroOffer(product: any): string {
  if (!product.introductoryPrice) {
    return `${product.priceString} per ${product.subscriptionPeriod}`;
  }

  const intro = product.introductoryPrice;
  const regular = product.priceString;

  if (intro.price === 0) {
    // Free trial
    return `Try free for ${intro.periodString}, then ${regular}`;
  } else if (intro.cycles === 1) {
    // Pay up front
    return `${intro.priceString} for ${intro.periodString}, then ${regular}`;
  } else {
    // Pay as you go
    return `${intro.priceString} for ${intro.cycles} ${intro.periodString}s, then ${regular}`;
  }
}
```

## Marketing Best Practices

### Trial Length Strategy
- **3-7 days**: Quick decision apps, games
- **7-14 days**: Standard for most apps
- **14-30 days**: Complex tools, professional apps
- **30+ days**: High-value B2B or enterprise

### Pricing Psychology
- **$0.99-$1.99**: Very low barrier, good for testing
- **50% off**: Strong perceived value
- **First month free**: Common, familiar pattern

### Communication Timing
- **Before trial ends**: Remind users of upcoming charge
- **Highlight value**: Show usage stats, achievements
- **Easy cancellation**: Build trust with transparent process

## Testing Intro Offers

Use sandbox testing to verify behavior:

```typescript
import { NativePurchases, PURCHASE_TYPE } from '@capgo/native-purchases';

// In sandbox mode, accelerated subscription durations apply:
// - 3 days free trial = 3 minutes
// - 1 week free trial = 3 minutes
// - 1 month free trial = 5 minutes

const { products } = await NativePurchases.getProducts({
  productIdentifiers: ['premium_monthly'],
  productType: PURCHASE_TYPE.SUBS,
});

// Purchase with intro offer
const transaction = await NativePurchases.purchaseProduct({
  productIdentifier: 'premium_monthly',
  productType: PURCHASE_TYPE.SUBS,
});

console.log('Intro purchase transaction:', transaction.transactionId);

// Wait for accelerated renewal
setTimeout(async () => {
  const { purchases } = await NativePurchases.getPurchases({
    productType: PURCHASE_TYPE.SUBS,
  });
  const premium = purchases.find((purchase) => purchase.productIdentifier === 'premium_monthly');
  console.log('After trial state:', premium?.subscriptionState);
}, 180000); // 3 minutes for weekly trial
```

## Important Notes

### Eligibility Rules
- One intro offer per user per subscription group (lifetime)
- Applies to new subscribers only
- Cannot be used again after cancellation
- Not available for subscription upgrades/crossgrades

### StoreKit API
- `introductoryPrice` shows intro offer details
- `eligibility` method checks if user qualifies
- Automatically applied at purchase time
- No special purchase method needed

### Limitations
- Only one intro offer active per subscription at a time
- Cannot combine with other discount types
- Cannot change eligibility rules
- Apple controls eligibility checking

## Troubleshooting

**Intro offer not showing:**
- Check if offer is activated in App Store Connect
- Verify user hasn't used an intro offer before
- Ensure user hasn't subscribed to anything in the group
- Test with new sandbox account

**Eligibility check failing:**
- Wait for App Store sync (can take 2-3 hours)
- Verify product ID is correct
- Check subscription group configuration
- Test in sandbox with fresh test account

**Wrong price displaying:**
- Check regional pricing settings
- Verify currency conversion
- Ensure offer dates are current
- Refresh product information

**Sandbox testing issues:**
- Use accelerated durations (3 min = 1 week)
- Create new test accounts for each test
- Wait for trial to complete naturally
- Check renewal count (max 6 in sandbox)

## Analytics and Optimization

### Track These Metrics
- Intro offer acceptance rate
- Trial-to-paid conversion rate
- Cancellation during trial
- Retention after first charge
- Revenue impact

### A/B Testing Ideas
- Free trial vs. paid intro
- Trial length variations
- Discount percentage
- Single payment vs. recurring discount

### Optimization Strategy
```typescript
// Track offer performance
analytics.track('intro_offer_displayed', {
  product_id: product.identifier,
  offer_type: product.introductoryPriceType,
  offer_duration: product.introductoryPricePeriod
});

analytics.track('intro_offer_accepted', {
  product_id: product.identifier
});

// Monitor conversion
NativePurchases.addListener('transactionUpdated', (transaction) => {
  if (transaction.productIdentifier === product.identifier && transaction.isActive) {
    analytics.track('trial_converted', {
      transactionId: transaction.transactionId,
      productId: transaction.productIdentifier,
    });
  }
});
```

## Next Steps

- [Configure sandbox testing](/docs/plugins/native-purchases/ios-sandbox-testing/) to test your intro offers
- Set up promotional offers for win-back campaigns
- Implement subscription analytics
- Create targeted marketing campaigns
