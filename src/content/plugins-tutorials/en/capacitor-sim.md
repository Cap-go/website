Benefits for iOS and Android mobile applications:
- Native sim performance on iOS and Android devices
- Unified API for both iOS and Android mobile platforms
- No need for separate native iOS or Android code
- Works with Capacitor and Cordova mobile frameworks
- Full TypeScript support for mobile app development
- Seamless integration with existing Capacitor mobile apps
