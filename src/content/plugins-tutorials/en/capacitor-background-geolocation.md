# Complete Tutorial: Using @capgo/capacitor-background-geolocation for iOS and Android Mobile Apps

The `@capgo/capacitor-background-geolocation` package provides native background geolocation functionality for your Capacitor mobile applications on iOS and Android. This comprehensive tutorial will guide you through integrating background geolocation features into your iOS and Android mobile apps built with Capacitor or Cordova, enabling cross-platform mobile app development with native capabilities.

## What is Capacitor?

Capacitor is Ionic's modern native runtime that enables developers to build native iOS apps, Android apps, and Progressive Web Apps from a single codebase. Unlike older Cordova-based mobile development, Capacitor provides direct access to native iOS and Android APIs, making it the ideal choice for building production-ready mobile applications. This Capacitor plugin brings background geolocation capabilities to both iOS and Android mobile platforms.

## Why Use background geolocation in Your Capacitor Mobile App?

The @capgo/capacitor-background-geolocation plugin enables your iOS and Android mobile applications to leverage native background geolocation functionality without writing platform-specific code. This Capacitor plugin provides a unified JavaScript API that works seamlessly on both iOS and Android mobile devices, making it perfect for cross-platform mobile app development.

Benefits for iOS and Android mobile applications:
- Native background geolocation performance on iOS and Android devices
- Unified API for both iOS and Android mobile platforms
- No need for separate native iOS or Android code
- Works with Capacitor and Cordova mobile frameworks
- Full TypeScript support for mobile app development
- Seamless integration with existing Capacitor mobile apps
