# Using @capgo/capacitor-mute Package

The `@capgo/capacitor-mute` package is a Capacitor plugin that allows you to detect if the mute switch is enabled or disabled on a device. It provides a simple API for checking the device's mute status.

## Installation

You can install the `@capgo/capacitor-mute` package using npm:

```bash
npm install @capgo/capacitor-mute
npx cap sync
```

## Usage

To use the `@capgo/capacitor-mute` package, you need to import it and call the `isMuted()` method.

```typescript
import { isMuted } from '@capgo/capacitor-mute';

isMuted().then((result) => {
  console.log('Mute status:', result);
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error('Error checking mute status:', error);
});
```

The `isMuted()` method returns a promise that resolves to a boolean value indicating whether the device is muted or not. If the promise is rejected, an error message is displayed.

## Example

Here is an example of how you can use the `@capgo/capacitor-mute` package to check the device's mute status and display a message based on the result.

```typescript
import { isMuted } from '@capgo/capacitor-mute';

isMuted().then((result) => {
  if (result) {
    console.log('The device is currently muted');
    // Display a message or perform some actions for muted device
  } else {
    console.log('The device is not muted');
    // Display a message or perform some actions for non-muted device
  }
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error('Error checking mute status:', error);
});
```

In this example, if the device is muted, a message "The device is currently muted" is displayed. If the device is not muted, a message "The device is not muted" is displayed.
