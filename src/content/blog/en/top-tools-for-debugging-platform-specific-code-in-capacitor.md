## Platform-Specific Debugging Methods

Building on core [debugging tools](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/debugging/), platform-specific techniques help fine-tune your [debugging process](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/debugging/) for greater accuracy.

### Native Bridge Testing

Debugging the communication between JavaScript and native platforms requires careful consideration of platform-specific differences. You can enable bridge logging to track events and observe platform behavior:

```javascript
Capacitor.addListener('bridgeEvent', (info) => {
  console.log(`Platform: ${Capacitor.getPlatform()}`);
  console.log(`Event data: ${JSON.stringify(info)}`);
});
```

When working with the native bridge, ensure you check the platform using `Capacitor.getPlatform()`:

```javascript
if (['ios', 'android'].includes(Capacitor.getPlatform())) {
  // Native-specific code
  await Plugin.doNativeOperation();
} else {
  // Web fallback
  webFallbackOperation();
}
```

### Source Map Configuration

To debug production issues more effectively, configure source maps for each platform in your build process:

```json
{
  "android": {
    "sourceMaps": true,
    "sourceMapStyle": "hidden",
    "webDir": "dist"
  },
  "ios": {
    "sourceMaps": true,
    "sourceMapStyle": "inline",
    "webDir": "dist"
  }
}
```

The table below highlights how source map settings impact debugging across platforms:

| Platform | Source Map Type | [Debugging Tool](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/debugging/) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iOS | Inline | Safari Web Inspector |
| Android | Hidden | Chrome DevTools |
| Web | External | Browser DevTools |

### Test Automation Setup

Customizing test configurations for each platform simplifies debugging while keeping shared logic intact. Here's an example of platform-specific test automation:

```javascript
describe('Platform Tests', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Platform-specific setup
    if (Capacitor.getPlatform() === 'ios') {
      setupIOSEnvironment();
    } else {
      setupAndroidEnvironment();
    }
  });

  test('native feature availability', async () => {
    const result = await Plugin.checkFeature();
    expect(result.available).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

Additionally, live update tools like Capgo (https://capgo.app) can speed up testing and issue resolution. Capgo supports instant updates for Capacitor apps and includes integrated analytics, error tracking, and rollback options [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

For critical scenarios, consider using feature detection with fallback mechanisms:

```javascript
async function checkPlatformCapabilities() {
  try {
    const platform = Capacitor.getPlatform();
    const features = await Plugin.getAvailableFeatures();

    return {
      platform,
      features,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Platform check failed: ${error.message}`);
    return null;
  }
}
```

These techniques help ensure your app performs well across all platforms.

## Tool Comparison Guide

Testing on multiple fronts ensures you catch issues early and allows for precise debugging tailored to each platform.

### Platform Detection

Leverage platform-specific code blocks to pinpoint and address unique problems:

```javascript
import { Capacitor } from '@capacitor/core';

if (Capacitor.getPlatform() === 'ios') {
    // iOS-specific debugging logic
} else if (Capacitor.getPlatform() === 'android') {
    // Android-specific debugging logic
}
```

This approach ensures accurate platform detection, making live updates more reliable across different operating systems.

### Live Update Systems
