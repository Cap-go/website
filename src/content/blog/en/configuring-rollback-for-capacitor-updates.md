Rollback in [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) ensures your app stays stable during over-the-air (OTA) updates. Here’s what you need to know:

-   **Automatic Rollback**: Automatically reverts to the last stable version if an update fails.
-   **Manual Rollback**: Lets developers manually roll back to a previous version for quick fixes.
-   **Default Bundle Backup**: If all updates fail, the app restores to its original package.

### How to Set It Up:

1.  **Automatic Rollback**: Use configurations like success rate thresholds (e.g., 95%) and monitoring periods (e.g., 5 minutes).
2.  **Manual Rollback**: Retain multiple versions for flexibility (e.g., last 5 versions).

### Management Tips:

-   Test updates in a staging environment before release.
-   Monitor update success rates and errors to trigger rollbacks early.
-   Use phased rollouts (e.g., 10%, 50%, 100%) to minimize impact.

### Platform Comparison:

**[Capgo](https://capgo.app/)** offers one-click rollbacks, encryption, real-time analytics, and flexible hosting. Alternatives like **[Capawesome](https://cloud.capawesome.io/)** and **[Appflow](https://ionic.io/appflow/)** lack features or come with higher costs.

**Quick Comparison Table:**

| Platform | Rollback Type | Analytics | Encryption | Hosting Options | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Capgo** | Auto/Manual | Yes | Yes | Flexible | Affordable |
| Capawesome | Manual Only | No  | No  | Limited | Lower |
| Appflow | Auto/Manual | Partial | No  | Limited | High |

With proper setup and tools like Capgo, you can ensure smooth updates and quickly address issues to keep your app running seamlessly.

## How Rollback Works in [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/)

![Capacitor](https://assets.seobotai.com/capgo.app/6802ea903c6b972ab5077c74/7e137b9b90adb3934b29b03381f213c1.jpg)

Capacitor includes a rollback feature that ensures app stability during over-the-air updates, acting as a safeguard against potential issues.

### Rollback Types

-   **Automatic Rollback**: If an update fails, Capacitor automatically reverts the app to its last stable version.
-   **Manual Rollback**: Developers can manually roll back to a previous version, allowing for quick fixes during phased rollouts or production problems [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

As an added safety net, Capacitor also relies on the original app package.

### Using the Default Bundle as a Backup

If all update attempts fail, Capacitor restores the app using the original bundle, ensuring the app remains functional.

## Setting Up Rollback: Step by Step

Here's how to set up both automatic and manual rollback options effectively.

### Auto Rollback Configuration

To enable automatic rollback, set up the detection and success criteria:

```typescript
const config = {
  autoRollback: true,
  timeout: 15000, // Timeout: 15 seconds
  checkInterval: 5000 // Check interval: 5 seconds
};
```

```typescript
const updateConfig = {
  minSuccessRate: 95, // Rollback if success rate drops below 95%
  monitorDuration: 300000 // Monitoring duration: 5 minutes
};
```

### Manual Rollback Setup

For manual rollback, customize the options as needed:

```typescript
const rollbackOptions = {
  versionControl: true,
  keepVersions: 5,    // Retain the last 5 versions
};
```

If you're using Capgo, you can initiate a rollback with just one click to any saved version.

For reference:

| Rollback Type | Timeout | Success Threshold | Monitoring Period |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Auto | 15 seconds | 95% | 5 minutes |
| Manual | N/A | User-defined | Continuous |

## Rollback Management Tips

Keep user impact low by testing, monitoring, and carefully deploying updates.

### Testing in Staging

Simulate rollback scenarios in a staging setup that mirrors production.

To check rollback readiness:

-   Deploy beta updates to small groups using Capgo channels [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).
-   If issues arise, trigger a rollback to the most recent stable version.

After testing, focus on monitoring the update's performance in the live environment.

### Update Performance Tracking

Stay on top of update performance to ensure smooth rollbacks:

-   Monitor live update success rates and user engagement [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).
-   Keep an eye on errors to initiate rollbacks early, avoiding major disruptions.
-   Leverage analytics to spot and resolve any bottlenecks.

Once monitoring is in place, release updates incrementally.

### Phased Update Release

Distribute updates gradually: start with 10%, then 50%, and finally 100% of your users [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

## Platform Rollback Features

Now that we've discussed rollback setup and best practices, let’s look at how top platforms handle rollbacks. The tools they offer can make a big difference in how quickly and reliably you recover from problematic updates.

**Capgo** stands out with its **one-click rollback** to any release. It also offers **end-to-end encryption**, **real-time analytics**, advanced deployment channels, and the flexibility of both cloud-hosted and self-hosted options [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

On the other hand, **Capawesome** falls short, lacking encryption, analytics, and hosting flexibility. Meanwhile, **Appflow** has a steep annual fee and an unclear roadmap, which can make it less attractive [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

When choosing a platform, key factors to weigh include **security**, the depth of analytics, deployment flexibility, and overall cost. Capgo combines rollback reliability, strong encryption, and cost-effectiveness, making it a solid option for teams of all sizes [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

## Summary

Ensuring smooth updates for your Capacitor app requires reliable rollback methods from the initial setup to phased releases. By configuring settings correctly and choosing the right platforms, teams can quickly address issues from faulty updates while keeping users happy.

A solid rollback plan includes a mix of automatic and manual options, real-time monitoring, gradual rollouts, and secure update pipelines. Tools such as Capgo simplify this process with features like one-click rollbacks, encrypted updates, and integrated analytics. With these strategies, your app can deliver consistent and reliable updates without interruptions.
