**Apple requires all apps on the [App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/) to provide an in-app option to delete user accounts.** This policy, enforced since June 30, 2022, ensures users can fully erase their data, giving them more control over their privacy. Here’s what you need to know:

-   **Key Requirements**:
    
    -   The **account deletion option** must be easy to find in the app’s settings.
    -   User data must be **completely removed**, except where retention is legally required.
    -   Apps using **"Sign in with Apple"** must revoke tokens via Apple’s REST API.
-   **For Developers**:
    
    -   Test the deletion process for ease of use and full data removal.
    -   Ensure third-party services also delete user data.
    -   Use tools like **[Capgo](https://capgo.app/)** for live updates and compliance monitoring.
-   **Common Issues**:
    
    -   Syncing deletions across platforms.
    -   Handling orphaned tokens and incomplete data purges.

Failure to comply can result in app rejection or removal from the App Store. Developers should prioritize user privacy and follow Apple’s guidelines to avoid issues.

## Technical Requirements

### Required Deletion Steps

The process for deleting an account must be straightforward and easy to find. Place it prominently in the app's account settings - not buried in submenus or external links.

Here are the key steps to include:

-   **Account Verification**: Ensure the user's identity is confirmed through an email code or SMS.
-   **Clear Communication**: Clearly explain what data will be deleted and highlight any legal requirements for retaining certain information.
-   **Confirmation Dialog**: Provide a final confirmation screen that outlines the consequences of deleting the account.

Additionally, use the Sign in with Apple REST API to revoke tokens during the account deletion process [\[2\]](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=12m75xbj)[\[3\]](https://www.ketch.com/blog/posts/apple-delete-account-requirement).

Once these steps are in place, focus on ensuring data removal aligns with these requirements.

### Data Removal Standards

| **Data Type** | **Removal Requirements** | **Legal Considerations** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User Content | Complete deletion | Temporary retention may be needed |
| Authentication Data | Immediate removal | Token revocation required |
| Third-party Data | Coordinated deletion | Compliance varies by service |
| Usage History | Full purge | Subject to legal retention rules |

If user data is stored with third-party services, make sure those services also delete the data. Industries with strict regulations may require additional customer service support to ensure compliance [\[2\]](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=12m75xbj).

It's crucial to verify adherence to these standards through comprehensive testing.

### Testing Requirements

Testing the account deletion process is essential for ensuring compliance and functionality. Use tools like [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and App Store review tools to focus on the following:

-   **Deletion Flow**: Confirm the process is user-friendly and easy to access.
-   **Data Verification**: Ensure all user data is completely removed across all systems.
-   **Edge Cases**: Test scenarios involving in-app purchases and third-party integrations.

For developers using [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) with Capgo, live updates can help address compliance issues quickly, bypassing the need to wait for App Store approval. During testing, make sure to verify:

-   Token revocation for users who signed in with Apple.
-   Complete data removal from all connected services.
-   Proper handling of active subscriptions.

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Platform Data Sync

Sometimes, data deletion on iOS and Android doesn't sync properly. This usually happens because of differences in how each platform handles storage and cached data.

Here’s how to tackle synchronization issues:

-   **Centralized Deletion Handler**: Develop a unified service to manage key tasks like:
    
    -   Cleaning up [local storage](https://capgo.app/plugins/capacitor-data-storage-sqlite/)
    -   Purging secure storage
    -   Ending cloud sync processes
    -   Handling token management
-   **Cross-Platform Event Broadcasting**: Use server-side logic to send deletion events to all active sessions and devices, ensuring consistency.
    

### Plugin Updates

After handling platform-wide deletion, you’ll need to address plugin-specific challenges. Ensuring plugins are compatible and aligned with your deletion process is critical to avoiding inconsistencies.

| **Issue** | **Impact** | **Solution** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Token Persistence | Orphaned tokens remain active | Set up automatic token revocation |
| Local Storage | Data cleanup may be incomplete | Perform recursive deletion checks |
| Cloud Sync | Deletion states may mismatch | Use synchronous handlers to ensure consistency |
