### Setup Instructions

1\. **Update `capacitor.config.ts` for live updates**

Add the following configuration to your Capacitor configuration file:

```typescript
{
  autoUpdateMethod: 'none',
  plugins: {
    LiveUpdates: {
      appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
      channel: 'production'
    }
  }
}
```

2\. **Install Required Plugins**

Run the following commands to add the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install @capacitor/app
npm install @ionic/live-updates
```

3\. **Add Update Logic to Your App**

Include code to check for updates and reload the app if an update is available. Here's an example:

```typescript
import { App } from '@capacitor/app';
import { LiveUpdates } from '@ionic/live-updates';

// Listen for the app resume event
App.addListener('resume', async () => {
  const update = await LiveUpdates.sync();
  if (update.available) {
    await LiveUpdates.reload();
  }
});
```

Capgo adds an extra layer of security with encryption and flexible deployment options. According to Martin Donadieu, Capgo's founder, these features are tailored to meet real-world developer needs and app store requirements.

To refine your [update process](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/manual-update/), use **Ionic Appflow** to monitor deployment success rates and user adoption. This setup ensures your app stays responsive and current.

Once live updates are in place, the next step is integrating them into a CI/CD pipeline to simplify and automate your deployment workflow.

## CI/CD Setup for Live Updates

### CI/CD Basics for Updates

CI/CD automates the process of integrating, testing, and deploying code, making live updates smoother and reducing potential errors. This approach ensures updates are delivered consistently while maintaining high-quality standards.

Here’s what a solid CI/CD pipeline for live updates typically includes:

Teams using automated CI/CD pipelines have reported a **75% reduction in deployment time** and an **80% improvement in app quality** thanks to consistent testing [\[1\]](https://www.kellton.com/kellton-tech-blog/mobile-ci-cd-challenges-in-app-development-lifecycle).

> "Automating your CI/CD workflow minimizes errors and boosts efficiency."

To monitor deployment performance, tools like Capgo’s dashboard can track success rates and pinpoint any bottlenecks. Once your CI/CD pipeline is set up, the next step is to focus on meeting security and compliance requirements for your live updates.

## Live Update Safety and Standards

### Security Requirements

To keep updates secure, use **HTTPS**, **digital signatures**, and **[multi-factor authentication](https://capgo.app/docs/webapp/mfa/)**. These measures protect data during transmission, confirm the source of updates, and stop unauthorized deployments. Encrypt update packages both during transmission and while stored to guard against potential risks.

After setting up these protections, it's crucial to test updates thoroughly and have recovery plans ready in case something goes wrong.

### Testing and Recovery Plans

A solid testing process reduces risks and ensures updates run smoothly:

| Testing Phase | Success Metrics |
| --- | --- |
| **Staging with Automated Tests** | 95% code coverage, identical functionality |
| **Phased Rollout** | Less than 0.1% failure rate |

Automated rollback systems can quickly detect and fix failures, helping maintain a 99.9% success rate for updates.

Once testing and recovery plans are in place, the next step is making sure users are informed about updates in a way that builds trust.

### Update Notifications

Clear communication about updates helps users feel confident in your app, supporting the security and testing efforts. Non-intrusive notifications, such as in-app banners or silent updates, are 72% more likely to gain user approval compared to forced updates.

When notifying users, aim for clarity and relevance. Use concise changelogs to explain what’s new and provide estimated update times to set expectations. This approach minimizes disruption while keeping users informed.
