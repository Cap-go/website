To stay compliant, developers should use tools for encryption, real-time monitoring, and [secure updates](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/hybrid-update/). Failing to comply can lead to severe penalties, so early preparation is key for success in the Chinese market.

## [China's Cybersecurity Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersecurity_Law_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China) Basics

### Main Legal Requirements

China's Cybersecurity Law outlines specific rules for handling data, directly impacting app developers. Key areas of focus include **data localization**, **security measures**, and **user privacy protection**.

For data localization, developers are required to store personal information - and any data considered crucial to national security or public interest - on servers located within mainland China.

Network operators, including app developers, must follow these security practices:

-   **Real-name registration systems**: Ensure users register with verified identities.
-   **Multi-factor authentication**: Secure access to sensitive information.
-   **Regular security checks**: Conduct vulnerability testing and security assessments.
-   **[Data encryption](https://capgo.app/docs/cli/migrations/encryption/)**: Encrypt data during both transmission and storage.
-   **Backup and recovery**: Maintain systems for data backup and recovery.

These requirements shape the way app developers must approach compliance.

### Scope for App Developers

The law applies to apps that collect, process, or store data from users in mainland China, regardless of where the developer is located. Here's what developers need to consider:

**Data Processing Requirements:**

-   Personal and sensitive information must be handled within China.
-   Cross-border data transfers require explicit regulatory approval.
-   Developers must set up monitoring and auditing systems.

**Technical Compliance:**

-   Apps must allow for quick data export in standardized formats.
-   Encryption standards approved by regulators must be followed.

For developers targeting Chinese users, compliance often involves working with local data centers or service providers. Since the law defines "critical data" broadly, developers need to carefully assess all data types their apps handle and ensure adequate protection measures are in place.

## Meeting Compliance Standards

### Data Storage Rules

To align with legal requirements, establish technical measures that ensure data is stored securely and locally. Sensitive information - such as user profiles, payment details, location data, device identifiers, and analytics - must be stored on servers located within mainland China. For transferring data internationally, secure explicit approval from the [Cyberspace Administration of China](https://www.cac.gov.cn/) (CAC). This includes submitting documentation that outlines the types of data, transfer frequency, security measures, and intended use.

### Required Security Checks

Before launching in China, you must complete these mandatory security assessments:

1.  **Technical Security Assessment**  
    This involves a detailed review of the app's security features, including encryption methods, access controls, and vulnerability testing. The evaluation must be carried out by a CAC-approved testing facility.
    
2.  **Data Protection Impact Assessment**  
    Developers must detail how personal data is collected, processed, and safeguarded. This includes documenting user consent mechanisms and data retention policies.
    
3.  **Network Security Review**  
    Apps managing critical infrastructure or sensitive data need an additional network security review. This focuses on server security, data backup systems, emergency response plans, and access controls.
    

These steps provide the foundation for implementing the technical changes required for compliance.

### App Changes Needed

The results of these assessments will highlight the technical updates needed for compliance:

-   **User Privacy Controls**:
    
    -   Clear consent options for data collection
    -   Detailed privacy settings
    -   Features to delete accounts and related data
    -   Transparent policies on data usage
-   **Security Features**:
    
    -   End-to-end encryption for sensitive information
    -   Multi-factor authentication
    -   Consistent security updates
    -   Automated threat detection systems

For apps that require frequent updates, consider integrating compliant update systems. For example, [Capgo](https://capgo.app/)'s live update solution provides end-to-end encryption and supports instant security patches while meeting both Chinese and international standards.

-   **Data Management Features**:
    -   Tools for users to export their data
    -   Audit logs to track data access
    -   Automated controls for data retention
    -   Restrictions based on geographic access

All these technical updates must be implemented before submitting your app for regulatory approval. Regular audits are essential to ensure ongoing compliance.
