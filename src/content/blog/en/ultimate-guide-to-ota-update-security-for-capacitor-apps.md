Over-the-air (OTA) updates are a fast way to improve [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) apps without app store delays. But they come with risks like code tampering, downgrade attacks, and data breaches. Here's how to secure your updates:

1.  **Encrypt Everything**: Use AES-256 for update files and RSA-2048 for secure key exchanges.
2.  **Sign Update Bundles**: Authenticate updates with private/public key pairs to prevent tampering.
3.  **Secure Data Transfer**: Enforce TLS 1.3 with certificate pinning to block interception.
4.  **Verify Files**: Use SHA-256 hashes to ensure update integrity.

### Quick Overview of Risks and Solutions

| **Risk** | **Impact** | **Solution** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Man-in-the-Middle | Malware injection | TLS 1.3, certificate pinning |
| Code Injection | App compromise | Bundle signing, file checks |
| Downgrade Attacks | Exploitation of old flaws | Version control, integrity checks |

To stay compliant with App Store and [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) rules, ensure updates are secure, transparent, and protect user data. Tools like [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) can automate encryption, signing, and monitoring for safer OTA updates.

## Security Basics for OTA Updates

In 2022, researchers discovered that 78% of devices with OTA capabilities had vulnerabilities in their update processes [\[5\]](https://sigmaos.com/tips/startups/internet-of-things-iot-terms-explained-over-the-air-ota-update). To address this, a strong security framework is crucial, focusing on three key areas: **bundle signing**, **secure data transfer**, and **file verification**. These elements are the backbone of the [encryption methods](https://capgo.app/docs/cli/migrations/encryption/) discussed later.

### Update Bundle Signing

Bundle signing is the first step to ensure only authorized updates are distributed. Developers use private keys to sign update bundles, while apps verify them using embedded public keys. For example, Capgo integrates public keys during the app build process, adhering to platform-specific security protocols.

| Signing Component | Purpose | Security Advantage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Private Key | Signs update bundles | Restricts update creation to authorized developers |
| Public Key | Verifies signatures | Confirms updates are legitimate and untampered |
| Digital Signature | Links bundle to developer | Ensures traceability and prevents tampering |

### Secure Data Transfer

Secure data transfer is critical for protecting updates during transmission. TLS 1.3 is the standard for this, reducing handshake times by 40% compared to TLS 1.2 [\[6\]](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/firmware-encryption-with-python). It also incorporates features like certificate pinning and mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication to block man-in-the-middle attacks and establish trust between the app and update server. Capgo enforces TLS 1.3 by default and supports custom certificate pinning setups, ensuring robust protection during data transfer.

### Update File Verification

File verification is the last defense before an update is installed. Cryptographic hash functions, such as SHA-256, create a unique fingerprint for each update package. Apps compare this fingerprint with server-provided hashes to ensure integrity. Automating SHA-256 hash generation and validation within CI/CD pipelines strengthens this process. Regularly integrating automated audits into CI/CD workflows also helps address new security challenges as they arise.

## Data Encryption for OTA Updates

Encryption adds an extra layer of security to the signing and verification processes, making intercepted data useless to attackers.

### Update Package Encryption

A two-step encryption process is used, combining **AES-256** for encrypting the update files and **RSA-2048** for securing the key exchange.

| Encryption Layer | Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Package Content | AES-256 | Protects the actual update files |
| Key Exchange | RSA-2048 | Secures the delivery of encryption keys |

Each update package is encrypted with a unique AES key, which is then encrypted using the device's public RSA key. Capgo applies this method automatically, generating fresh encryption keys for every update distribution [\[4\]](https://parsers.vc/news/250207-navigating-the-new-frontier-of-mobile-app/).

### Encryption Key Security

Proper key management is essential to ensure encrypted updates remain secure:

-   **Key Generation**: Always use secure random generators to create encryption keys.
-   **Key Storage**: Store keys in hardware-backed secure environments like Android's [StrongBox](https://source.android.com/docs/security/best-practices/hardware) or iOS's [Secure Enclave](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-enclave-sec59b0b31ff/web) [\[5\]](https://sigmaos.com/tips/startups/internet-of-things-iot-terms-explained-over-the-air-ota-update)[\[7\]](https://www.sorinmustaca.com/implementing-secure-over-the-air-ota-updates-in-embedded-devices/).
-   **Key Rotation**: Update encryption keys every 90 days. Use phased transitions to maintain compatibility and align key rotations with your CI/CD pipelines.

### Device Security Features

Modern devices come with built-in hardware security designed to protect encryption keys. For instance, Android's StrongBox and iOS's Secure Enclave provide isolated environments for cryptographic tasks [\[5\]](https://sigmaos.com/tips/startups/internet-of-things-iot-terms-explained-over-the-air-ota-update)[\[7\]](https://www.sorinmustaca.com/implementing-secure-over-the-air-ota-updates-in-embedded-devices/). iOS developers can leverage these features using native Security framework APIs.

These encryption practices help meet the industry standards covered in the following sections.

## Meeting Industry Standards

Ensuring secure OTA updates means strictly following platform rules and data protection laws. The compliance landscape is intricate, with different demands from app stores and privacy regulations.

These standards rely on core security practices like encryption and signing, paired with platform-specific rules.

### App Store Rules

Apple's App Store guideline 2.5.2 imposes clear restrictions on OTA updates for [Capacitor apps](https://capgo.app/blog/capacitor-comprehensive-guide/). Updates can only modify web content like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within the app container - changing native functionality is not allowed [\[1\]](https://github.com/capacitor-community/android-security-provider).

| Platform | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| Apple App Store | Web-only updates • No executable code • Pre-download disclosure |
| Google Play | HTTPS enforcement • Integrity checks • Feature update restrictions |

Google Play provides more flexibility but still enforces strict security measures [\[3\]](https://insight.sbdautomotive.com/rs/164-IYW-366/images/Preparing%20for%20regulated%20automotive%20over-the-air%20updates.pdf). Updates must use secure transfer protocols and include proper integrity checks.

### Privacy Laws

Privacy regulations further complicate OTA update compliance. Laws like GDPR and [CCPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act) set clear rules for handling user data during updates.

| OTA Update Aspect | GDPR | CCPA |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data Collection | Minimal necessary data | Full disclosure required |
| User Rights | Explicit consent needed | Opt-out option mandatory |
| Security Measures | End-to-end encryption | Reasonable security |
| Documentation | [Update process](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/manual-update/) documentation | Update process documentation |

> "The key to maintaining compliance is implementing privacy by design principles from the outset", explains a European Data Protection Board guidance document. "This includes incorporating data protection considerations into every aspect of the update process." [\[8\]](https://essaypro.com/blog/article-review)

For Capacitor apps, this means focusing on practical steps like:

-   **Transparent Updates**: Clearly disclose update contents and how data is used.
-   **Secure Data Transfers**: Use end-to-end encryption for all update-related communications.

GDPR violations can result in penalties of up to €20 million [\[9\]](https://www.socialsellinator.com/social-selling-blog/seo-article-writing). To stay compliant, conduct quarterly audits and align them with your update monitoring processes.
