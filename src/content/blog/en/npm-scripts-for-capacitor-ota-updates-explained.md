## npm Scripts Setup for OTA Updates

Here's how to configure npm scripts to manage [Capacitor OTA updates](https://capgo.app/ja/) effectively. This involves installing necessary packages, setting up configurations, and creating deployment scripts.

### Installing Required Packages

First, install the required packages. The [Capgo CLI tool](https://capgo.app/docs/cli/commands) simplifies this process with built-in commands:

```bash
npm install @capgo/cli --save-dev
npm install @capacitor/cli --save-dev
```

Then, initialize the OTA configuration using the following command:

```bash
npx @capgo/cli init
```

### Configuring OTA Updates

Update your `capacitor.config.json` file with the following settings to prepare your app for OTA updates:

```json
{
  "appId": "com.your.app",
  "appName": "Your App",
  "plugins": {
    "CapacitorUpdates": {
      "autoUpdate": true,
      "updateUrl": "https://api.capgo.app/updates",
      "statsUrl": "https://api.capgo.app/stats"
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration ensures your app can fetch updates automatically and report statistics.

### Creating Deployment Scripts

Add these npm scripts to your `package.json` file to streamline the build and deployment process:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:web": "npm run build",
    "build:update": "npx @capgo/cli build",
    "deploy:update": "npx @capgo/cli upload",
    "deploy:production": "npm run build:web && npm run build:update && npm run deploy:update"
  }
}
```

-   **`build:web`**: Builds web assets, typically used during development and deployment.
-   **`build:update`**: Prepares the update package for OTA updates.
-   **`deploy:update`**: Uploads the update package to Capgo.
-   **`deploy:production`**: Handles the complete build and deployment workflow, ideal for production releases.

### Setting Environment Variables

To finalize the setup, define these environment variables:

```bash
CAPGO_TOKEN=your_api_token
CAPGO_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### Compatibility and Reliability

The Capgo CLI supports Capacitor 6 and 7, ensuring it works with the latest versions while maintaining dependable update functionality.

| Script Command | Purpose | When to Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **build:web** | Builds web assets | During development and deployment |

## Adding npm Scripts to CI/CD

Integrating npm scripts into your CI/CD pipeline can simplify the Over-The-Air (OTA) update process for Capacitor apps. Here's a guide to setting up automated deployments efficiently.

### CI/CD Build Setup

Configure your CI/CD environment with the necessary variables and steps:

```yaml
environment:
  CAPGO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CAPGO_TOKEN }}
  CAPGO_APP_ID: ${{ secrets.CAPGO_APP_ID }}
  NODE_ENV: production
```

For optimal performance, include caching in your build process:

```yaml
cache:
  paths:
    - node_modules/
    - .npm/
    - dist/
```

### [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions) Setup Guide

![GitHub Actions](https://assets.seobotai.com/capgo.app/67fb02ab2e221594daf3f266/14ecce2811e9ac36444c59b954e81473.jpg)

To automate your deployment workflow, create a `.github/workflows/ota-deploy.yml` file with this configuration:

```yaml
name: Deploy OTA Update
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run deployment
        run: npm run deploy:production
        env:
          CAPGO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CAPGO_TOKEN }}
          CAPGO_APP_ID: ${{ secrets.CAPGO_APP_ID }}
```

This setup ensures your app is deployed automatically whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

### Update Recovery and Fixes

To handle potential update failures, include recovery mechanisms in your CI/CD pipeline. These features can help maintain app stability:

| Recovery Feature | Implementation | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Version Rollback** | `npm run revert:update` | Reverts to the last stable version |
| **Health Checks** | `npm run verify:update` | Ensures the update is functioning properly |
| **Auto-retry** | `maxRetries: 3` in config | Attempts the update multiple times |

You can enhance your deployment script to manage errors automatically. For example:

```bash
npm run deploy:production || npm run revert:update
```

This script ensures that if a deployment fails, the system will revert to the previous stable version. Additionally, your CI/CD pipeline can send status reports and trigger notifications through your preferred platform.

## OTA Update Management Tips

Effectively managing OTA updates involves keeping a close eye on version control, rigorous testing, and strong security protocols. Here's how you can streamline updates using npm scripts.

### Version Management

Semantic versioning is a simple way to manage app updates. Here's an example configuration:

```json
{
  "version": "2.5.0",
  "scripts": {
    "update:major": "npm version major && npm run deploy:update",
    "update:minor": "npm version minor && npm run deploy:update",
    "update:patch": "npm version patch && npm run deploy:update"
  }
}
```

Using separate channels like Production, Beta, Alpha, and Hotfix allows for targeted rollouts. These strategies make it easier to test updates and ensure smooth deployments.

### Update Testing Steps

Automated testing is essential for catching issues early. Use npm scripts to simplify the process:

```bash
npm run test:update -- --channel=beta
npm run verify:deployment
npm run monitor:metrics
```

Testing updates in stages through different channels helps identify problems before they reach all users. Automated rollback procedures are another safety net to maintain app stability.

### Update Security Measures

Security is critical in OTA updates. Here are some key measures to put in place:

| Security Feature | Implementation | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| End-to-End Encryption | Provided by Capgo | Protects against data breaches |
| Update Signing | Package verification | Confirms updates are genuine |
| Access Control | Role-based permissions | Restricts team access |

> "The only solution with true end-to-end encryption, others just sign updates" - Capgo [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

To ensure updates are secure, configure npm scripts to validate everything before deployment:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run security:check",
    "deploy": "capgo upload --encrypt",
    "security:check": "npm audit && npm run validate:bundle"
  }
}
```

Additionally, enforce channel-specific security policies and use role-based permissions to control who can distribute updates. This adds an extra layer of protection to your deployment process.
