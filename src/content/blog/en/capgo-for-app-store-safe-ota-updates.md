## 1\. Capgo Features

Capgo's platform offers powerful over-the-air (OTA) update capabilities, ensuring secure and efficient app updates. With **end-to-end encryption**, updates are accessible only to authorized users, keeping deployments secure from start to finish.

Capgo works effortlessly with popular CI/CD platforms like **[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions), [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops), [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)**. The platform also provides a one-time CI/CD setup for $2,600, which is far more affordable than AppFlow's $6,000 annual fee. This integration simplifies deployment while adhering to app store regulations.

The platform's **user assignment system** gives developers precise control over update distribution. This feature allows for targeted rollouts and beta testing while staying within app store policies. As colenso shared:

> "We rolled out [Capgo OTA](https://development.capgo.app/) updates in production for our user base of +5000. We're seeing very smooth operation almost all our users are upto date within minutes of the OTA being deployed to @Capgo."

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of Capgo's standout features:

| Feature Category | Capabilities | Benefits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Security | End-to-end encryption | Keeps updates accessible only to authorized users |
| Integration | Azure DevOps, GitLab, GitHub, Jenkins | Simplifies the deployment process |
| Distribution | User assignment system | Enables controlled rollouts and testing |
| Management | Multiple organization support | Provides detailed permission control |

Capgo also supports **multi-organization management**, letting teams create and manage separate organizations with tailored user permissions. This adds another layer of control to your update workflows.

## 2\. Standard App Store Updates

Updating apps through traditional app stores comes with its own set of challenges. The required review process often delays the time between identifying a problem and releasing a fix. This forces developers to group several changes into a single update, making testing and deployment more complicated. These delays make it harder to quickly address issues and improve apps continuously, creating a need for faster solutions that still meet app store rules.

Development teams today are looking for ways to speed up updates while staying compliant with app store guidelines. Tools like Capgo provide an option, allowing developers to release updates multiple times a week - improving efficiency by as much as 81% [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/). This shows how traditional update processes can hold back agile development, increasing the demand for tools that support quick releases without breaking the rules.

These changes in how updates are managed are part of a larger trend in the industry. Teams aim to create faster, more responsive workflows while still meeting the quality and security standards set by app stores.

## 3\. Alternative OTA Platforms

Standard app store updates can be slow, making alternative OTA platforms an appealing option for faster, compliant updates. Several platforms are stepping up to meet this demand.

Microsoft's App Center recently stopped supporting live updates for hybrid apps, leaving developers searching for new solutions. Simon Flack shared his perspective on this shift:

> "We are currently giving a try to @Capgo since Appcenter stopped live updates support on hybrid apps and @AppFlow is way too expensive."

Ionic's AppFlow remains an option, but many developers criticize its high cost and limited functionality. At $6,000 per year - compared to the usual $300 per month for CI/CD tools - it's a tough sell for some. LeVar Berry expressed his frustrations:

> "Cancelled my @Appflow subscription after 4 years. Code-Push never seemed to work well, hopefully @CapGO has it figured out."

To better understand the landscape, here's a quick comparison of key OTA platforms:

| Platform | Key Features | Limitations | Cost Structure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AppFlow | Built-in Ionic integration | Functionality concerns | $6,000/year |
| App Center | Backed by Microsoft | No hybrid app support | Free tier available |
| Capgo | End-to-end encryption; CI/CD ready | Still maturing as a platform | ~$300/month for CI/CD |

The industry is clearly looking for more affordable and reliable OTA solutions. Even NASA's [OSIRIS-REx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSIRIS-REx) team weighed in:

> "@Capgo is a smart way to make hot code pushes (and not for all the money in the world like with @AppFlow) ðŸ™‚."

These changes underscore the growing need to balance fast deployment with app store rules, without breaking the bank.

## Benefits and Limitations

Take a closer look at OTA update methods, drawing insights from real-world examples and developer feedback.

| Update Method | Key Benefits | Notable Limitations | Cost Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Traditional App Store | â€¢ Built-in user trust  <br>â€¢ Guaranteed compliance  <br>â€¢ No extra infrastructure needed | â€¢ Long approval times  <br>â€¢ Limited update frequency  <br>â€¢ Higher development effort | Base app store fees |
| Capgo OTA | â€¢ Instant updates  <br>â€¢ End-to-end encryption  <br>â€¢ CI/CD integration  <br>â€¢ Control over user assignments | â€¢ Initial setup effort  <br>â€¢ Platform-specific limitations | $2,600 setup + ~$300/month |
| AppFlow | â€¢ Seamless Ionic integration  <br>â€¢ Enterprise-grade support  <br>â€¢ Comprehensive tools | â€¢ High upfront cost barrier | $6,000/year |

This table highlights the balance between fast OTA updates and conventional app store methods. Capgo stands out by offering **instant deployments** and **strong security measures**, addressing common delays and risks tied to app store updates.

Capgo's use of end-to-end encryption ensures updates are accessible only to authorized users, making it a more secure option than traditional methods. Its proven performance - delivering **947.6 million updates** across **1,400 production apps** - shows its reliability for large-scale projects [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

Even NASA's OSIRIS-REx team praised Capgo for its cost-efficient approach:

> "@Capgo is a smart way to make hot code pushes (and not for all the money in the world like with @AppFlow) ðŸ™‚"

While app store updates can take weeks for approval, Capgo enables developers to release updates multiple times a week, keeping development cycles agile. The choice between these methods depends on your project's needs, team expertise, and available budget.
