Android devices with 16 KB memory pages are rolling out. If a Capacitor plugin (or one of its native dependencies) isn’t ready, a feature may stop working or the app may crash on some phones. Enforcement is ramping up, so plan a fix soon.

Important: Starting November 1st, 2025, all new apps and updates to existing apps submitted to Google Play and targeting Android 15+ devices must support 16 KB page sizes on 64-bit devices.

This guide keeps it simple: find the plugin that breaks, check for an easy update, and if the plugin looks unmaintained, ask [Capgo Consulting](/consulting) to fork and maintain it for you.

## Symptoms on 16 KB Devices

- Works on some Android phones, breaks on others (often newer models).
- A feature stops working when a specific plugin is used (camera, files, Bluetooth, etc.).
- Debug sometimes works, Release doesn’t.

Tip: Try on a recent flagship Android device to reproduce early.

## Step 1 — Make Sure It’s a Plugin Issue

- Reproduce the problem and note the feature you’re using.
- Temporarily hide/disable that feature in code. If the problem disappears, the related plugin is likely the cause.

## Step 2 — Find Which Plugin Is Failing

- Turn features off one by one (or comment out the plugin calls) until the app stops failing.
- The last feature you disabled before it started working again points to the problem plugin.

## Step 3 — Check for a Quick Fix

Once you know the plugin:

- Update to the latest version of the plugin and your Capacitor packages.
- Read the plugin’s README/changelog for Android 16 KB notes.
- Check open issues/discussions for similar reports and recommended versions.

## Step 4 — Ask the Maintainer

If the latest version still breaks:

- Open a short, clear issue: “Breaks on Android devices with 16 KB page size; feature X no longer works.”
- Include your Capacitor version, plugin version, and a quick repro description.
- Wait a bit for a response — some teams need a few days.

## Step 5 — If the Plugin Looks Unmaintained

Signs to watch for:

- No releases or maintainer replies for months.
- Multiple open issues about Android compatibility without answers.

Your options:

- Replace it with an actively maintained alternative.
- Or ask [Capgo Consulting](/consulting) to fork and maintain it so your app stays compatible.

## Step 6 — Sanity Checks

Before shipping, do quick checks:

- Test the feature on at least one recent Android device and one older device.
- Use a Release build for a final test.
- Keep a note of app version, plugin version, and device model that passed.

## Step 7 — Decide: Update, Replace, or Fork

- Update: best case — install the latest plugin/app versions and you’re done.
- Replace: switch to a maintained alternative if one exists.
- Fork: when you need it working and the plugin isn’t moving, let [Capgo Consulting](/consulting) fork and maintain it for you.

## Support Bundle (Short and Useful)

Share this to speed up help (with maintainers or [Capgo Consulting](/consulting)):

- App version/build number
- Capacitor version
- Plugin name and version
- Devices/Android versions affected
- What you tried (update, alternative, etc.)
- Simple steps to reproduce
