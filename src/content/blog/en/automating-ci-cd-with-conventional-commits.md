**Want to simplify your [CI/CD pipeline](https://capgo.app/blog/setup-ci-and-cd-gitlab/)?** Conventional Commits can help by automating versioning, changelog creation, and deployment. Here's how:

-   Use a standard commit format like `feat: add new feature` or `fix: resolve issue`.
-   Automate [version updates](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/hybrid-update/) based on commit types (e.g., `fix` = patch, `feat` = minor).
-   Generate changelogs automatically for better transparency.
-   Enforce commit standards with tools like [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) and [Husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky).
-   Integrate [semantic-release](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release) for seamless versioning and releases.
-   Streamline [mobile app updates](https://capgo.app/plugins/capacitor-updater/) with tools like [Capgo](https://capgo.app/).

**Key Benefits:**

-   Clear, machine-readable commit history.
-   Reduced manual errors in versioning and deployment.
-   Faster and more reliable CI/CD processes.

**Quick Example:**

1.  Install Commitlint and Husky to enforce commit rules.
2.  Use semantic-release to automate versioning and changelog updates.
3.  Set up [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions) for end-to-end CI/CD automation.

This setup ensures your team spends less time managing commits and more time building great software.

## CI/CD Pipeline Setup Guide

Streamline your CI/CD pipeline by automating it with Conventional Commits. Follow these steps to get everything configured.

### Setting Up [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/)

![Commitlint](https://assets.seobotai.com/capgo.app/682a83945642a17d106f059a/8461397ae4d63c2641a01948372bfa37.jpg)

Commitlint helps enforce the Conventional Commits specification, ensuring consistent and meaningful commit messages.

-   **Install Required Dependencies**

Start by installing Commitlint, its conventional configuration, and Husky:

```bash
npm install @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional --save-dev
npm install husky --save-dev
```

-   **Configure Commitlint**

Create a `commitlint.config.js` file in your project’s root directory to define the rules:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional'],
    rules: {
        'header-max-length': [2, 'always', 50],
        'type-enum': [2, 'always', [
            'feat', 'fix', 'docs', 'style', 'refactor',
            'perf', 'test', 'build', 'ci', 'chore'
        ]]
    }
}
```

-   **Enable Git Hooks**

Use Husky to set up Git hooks that enforce commit message standards:

```bash
npx husky install
npm set-script prepare "husky install"
npx husky add .husky/commit-msg "npx --no -- commitlint --edit $1"
```

### Implementing [semantic-release](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release)

![semantic-release](https://assets.seobotai.com/capgo.app/682a83945642a17d106f059a/b1a89ed4cab10959264a239917f868aa.jpg)

Automate versioning, changelog creation, and releases with semantic-release.

-   **Install Dependencies**

Install semantic-release along with plugins for Git and changelog generation:

```bash
npm install semantic-release @semantic-release/git @semantic-release/changelog --save-dev
```

-   **Configure Release Rules**

Add a `.releaserc` file to define how semantic-release handles versioning and assets:

```json
{
    "branches": ["main"],
    "plugins": [
        "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
        "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
        ["@semantic-release/changelog", {
            "changelogFile": "CHANGELOG.md"
        }],
        "@semantic-release/npm",
        ["@semantic-release/git", {
            "assets": ["package.json", "CHANGELOG.md"],
            "message": "chore(release): ${nextRelease.version} [skip ci]"
        }]
    ]
}
```

### GitHub Actions Implementation

Set up a GitHub Actions workflow to validate commits and [automate CI/CD processes](https://capgo.app/blog/automatic-build-and-release-with-gitlab/).

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  verify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Verify Commits
        uses: wagoid/commitlint-github-action@v5

  release:
    needs: verify
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18.x'

      - name: Release
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
        run: npx semantic-release
```

### Key Features of This Setup

This configuration ensures:

-   Commit messages are automatically validated.
-   Semantic versions are generated based on commit types.
-   Changelogs are created and updated automatically.
-   Releases are triggered and managed without manual intervention.

| Commit Type | Version Bump | Example Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fix | Patch (0.0.x) | Bug fixes or patches |
| feat | Minor (0.x.0) | New features added |
| feat! or fix! | Major (x.0.0) | Breaking changes introduced |

With this foundation in place, you’re ready to explore more advanced automation techniques in the following sections.

## Advanced CI/CD Automation Methods

### Breaking Change Detection

Identifying breaking changes is essential for maintaining proper semantic versioning. Automation tools can help detect these changes and trigger the necessary version updates.

For example, breaking changes can be signaled by appending a '!' to the commit header or by including a 'BREAKING CHANGE' footer. Here's a sample implementation:

```javascript
// Example implementation for breaking change detection
module.exports = {
  analyzeCommits: (commits) => {
    const hasBreakingChange = commits.some(commit => {
      return commit.notes.some(note => note.title === 'BREAKING CHANGE') ||
             commit.header.includes('!');
    });
    return hasBreakingChange ? 'major' : null;
  }
};
```

This ensures that breaking changes are flagged and handled appropriately, streamlining the versioning process and reducing errors in complex repositories.

### Monorepo Commit Management

Managing commits in monorepos can be tricky, especially when dealing with multiple components. To optimize build processes, you can implement selective builds that focus only on the affected components. Here's an example configuration:

```yaml
# Example configuration for selective builds
trigger:
  paths:
    - 'packages/core/**'
    - 'packages/api/**'
    - 'shared/**'
```

Selective builds ensure efficiency by targeting specific components. Here's how different component types can be handled:

| Component Type | Build Strategy | Version Control |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared Libraries | Build when dependencies change | Centralized versioning |
| Independent Services | Isolated builds | Package-specific versions |
| Core Components | Priority builds | Strict version control |

This approach complements automated versioning methods, such as those based on Conventional Commits, by ensuring that only necessary builds are triggered.

### Security and Compliance Checks

Automating security and compliance checks is crucial for maintaining code quality and meeting regulatory standards. For instance, tools like [Cocogitto](https://docs.cocogitto.io/) updated their GitHub Actions in March 2025 to enforce the conventional commits specification, highlighting the growing importance of automated compliance checks [\[2\]](https://github.com/cocogitto/cocogitto).

You can configure your CI/CD pipeline to include these checks:

```yaml
security-compliance:
  script:
    - commitlint --from $CI_COMMIT_BEFORE_SHA --to $CI_COMMIT_SHA
    - security-scan --severity high
    - compliance-check --standard pci-dss
```

Here's an overview of the tools and their purposes:

| Check Type | Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Commit Format | Commitlint | Ensures conventional commit compliance |
| Security Scanning | SAST/DAST | Identifies vulnerabilities |
| Compliance | Custom Rules | Validates regulatory requirements |
