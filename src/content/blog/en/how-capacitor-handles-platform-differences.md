[Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) helps developers build apps for iOS and Android using the same codebase, while addressing platform-specific differences. It simplifies native feature integration, ensures compliance with platform guidelines, and optimizes performance. Key highlights:

-   **Platform Detection**: Use `Capacitor.getPlatform()` to apply platform-specific code.
-   **Built-in Plugins**: Unified APIs for features like Camera, Storage, and Geolocation.
-   **Custom Plugins**: Add native code for unique requirements.
-   **UI Adjustments**: Follow design rules for iOS (e.g., [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/), rounded buttons) and Android (e.g., [Material Icons](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/material_icons), left-aligned buttons).
-   **Configuration**: Adjust settings in `capacitor.config.json` for both platforms.
-   **Live Updates with [Capgo](https://capgo.app/)**: Deploy updates instantly without app store delays, achieving up to 95% user adoption within 24 hours.

### Quick Comparison

| Feature | iOS | Android |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Navigation** | Bottom tab bars, back button left | Top navigation drawer, bottom nav |
| **Typography** | San Francisco font | Roboto font |
| **Plugins (e.g., Camera)** | [AVFoundation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/) | [Camera2 API](https://developer.android.com/media/camera/camera2) |
| **Build Output** | `.ipa` file | `.aab` or `.apk` file |

Capacitor bridges the gap between web and native app development, making it easier to create cross-platform apps while maintaining platform-specific optimizations.

## How [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) Handles Platform Code

![Capacitor](https://mars-images.imgix.net/seobot/screenshots/capacitorjs.com-4c1a6a7e452082d30f5bff9840b00b7d-2025-03-25.jpg?auto=compress)

Capacitor offers tools to manage platform-specific code, allowing developers to create tailored experiences for iOS and Android using a single API.

### Detect Platforms in Code

With Capacitor's built-in platform API, detecting the current platform is simple. The `Capacitor.getPlatform()` method identifies the running environment, making it easy to apply conditional logic:

```typescript
import { Capacitor } from '@capacitor/core';

const platform = Capacitor.getPlatform();
if (platform === 'ios') {
  // Code specific to iOS
} else if (platform === 'android') {
  // Code specific to Android
}
```

This approach is especially handy for features like [biometric authentication](https://capgo.app/plugins/capacitor-native-biometric/), where iOS might use [Face ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_ID) and Android relies on Fingerprint Authentication. Along with platform detection, Capacitor's built-in plugins simplify native integration.

### Built-in Platform Features

Capacitor comes with a set of core plugins that handle platform-specific differences seamlessly. These plugins manage the complexities of native implementations while providing a consistent JavaScript interface:

| Plugin | iOS Implementation | Android Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Camera | AVFoundation | Camera2 API |
| Storage | UserDefaults | SharedPreferences |
| Geolocation | CoreLocation | LocationManager |

Each plugin automatically uses the platform's native APIs, ensuring smooth performance and functionality.

### Build Custom Platform Plugins

For cases where built-in plugins don't meet your needs, you can create custom plugins to access specific native APIs. Here's how:

1.  **Define the Plugin**
    
    ```typescript
    @Plugin({
      name: 'CustomFeature',
      platforms: ['ios', 'android']
    })
    ```
    
2.  **Add Native Code**
    
    ```typescript
    @PluginMethod()
    async customFunction(): Promise<void> {
      if (Capacitor.getPlatform() === 'ios') {
        // Add iOS-specific code
      } else {
        // Add Android-specific code
      }
    }
    ```
    
3.  **Implement Platform Handlers**
    
    -   **iOS (Swift):**
        
        ```swift
        @objc func customFunction(_ call: CAPPluginCall) {
          // Add native iOS functionality
        }
        ```
        
    -   **Android (Kotlin):**
        
        ```kotlin
        @PluginMethod
        fun customFunction(call: PluginCall) {
          // Add native Android functionality
        }
        ```
        

Custom plugins allow access to native features while keeping the API consistent and easy to use. This ensures performance and functionality without complicating the development process.

## Platform-Specific UI Guidelines

### iOS vs Android Design Rules

When designing for iOS and Android, it's important to follow native design patterns. Users on each platform have different expectations for things like navigation, typography, buttons, headers, and icons. Here's how they compare:

| Design Element | iOS | Android |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Navigation** | Bottom tab bars, back button on the left | Top navigation drawer, bottom navigation |
| **Typography** | San Francisco font | Roboto font |
| **Buttons** | Rounded rectangles, centered text | Material Design buttons, left-aligned text |
| **Headers** | Large titles, centered | App bars, left-aligned |
| **Icons** | SF Symbols | Material Icons |

### Cross-Platform Design Standards

While each platform has its own rules, maintaining a cohesive brand identity across both is key. Hereâ€™s how you can ensure consistency:

```typescript
const sharedStyles = {
  primaryColor: '#007AFF', // iOS blue
  androidPrimaryColor: '#6200EE', // Material Design purple
  borderRadius: Capacitor.getPlatform() === 'ios' ? '10px' : '4px'
};

:root {
  --app-header-height: var(--platform-header-height, 56px);
  --app-safe-area-top: var(--platform-safe-area-top, 0px);
}
```

Using Capacitor, you can integrate platform-specific UI components while keeping functionality consistent. It also helps manage system-wide settings like Dark Mode and Dynamic Type. To complete the process, make sure your platform-specific build settings align with these guidelines.

## Platform Setup and Config

After managing your platform code, proper configuration is essential to ensure your app runs smoothly on both iOS and Android.

### Platform Settings in `capacitor.config.json`

Use the `capacitor.config.json` file to define key platform-specific settings:

```json
{
  "appId": "com.example.app",
  "appName": "MyApp",
  "ios": {
    "contentInset": "always",
    "backgroundColor": "#ffffff",
    "scheme": "myapp",
    "preferredContentMode": "mobile"
  },
  "android": {
    "backgroundColor": "#FFFFFF",
    "allowMixedContent": true,
    "captureInput": true,
    "webContentsDebuggingEnabled": true
  }
}
```

Here are some configuration options to consider:

| Option | iOS | Android |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Deep Links** | `scheme` property | `androidScheme` property |
| **Status Bar** | `statusBar.style` | `statusBar.backgroundColor` |
| **Keyboard** | `keyboard.resize` | `keyboard.resize`, `keyboard.style` |
| **Splash Screen** | `splashScreen.launchShowDuration` | `splashScreen.layoutName` |

Once runtime settings are in place, adjust your build settings to enhance performance for each platform.

### Platform-Specific Build Settings

Fine-tune build settings to optimize your app for iOS and Android.

For iOS, update the `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Required for document scanning</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Required for store locator</string>
```

For Android, modify `android/app/build.gradle`:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
        targetSdkVersion 33
        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0"
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt')
        }
    }
}
```

Here are some key build considerations:

| Aspect | iOS | Android |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Permissions** | Add entries in `Info.plist` | Define in `AndroidManifest.xml` |
| **Icons** | Sizes from 20px to 1024px | Densities from mdpi to xxxhdpi |
| **Splash Screen** | Storyboard-based | Layout XML-based |
| **Build Output** | `.ipa` file | `.aab` or `.apk` file |
