[Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) Over-The-Air (OTA) updates let you push app changes directly to users without waiting for app store approvals. With **version targeting**, you can deliver updates to specific app versions, ensuring compatibility and reducing risks like crashes.

Here’s what you’ll learn:

-   **What OTA Updates Are**: Push changes instantly to users while staying compliant with app store rules.
    
-   **Version Targeting**: Send updates only to specific app versions to fix bugs, roll out features, or support legacy users.
    
-   **Benefits**:
    
    -   Faster updates (minutes, not weeks).
        
    -   Better app stability and controlled rollouts.
        
    -   Improved user experience by avoiding unnecessary updates.
        
-   **How to Use It**:
    
    -   Follow semantic versioning (**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**).
        
    -   [Configure updates](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/manual-update/) in your Capacitor project.
        
    -   Test thoroughly across targeted versions.
        

**Quick Comparison**:

| **Aspect** | **Traditional Updates** | **OTA with Version Targeting** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deployment Time | Days to weeks | Minutes |
| Update Precision | Same update for all users | Targeted updates by version |
| Risk Management | Higher risk of widespread issues | Controlled rollout by version |

[Capgo](https://capgo.app/), a leading platform, reports an **81% efficiency boost** in release cycles and has delivered over **947.6 million updates** globally.

**Version Targeting Technical Guide**

Semantic versioning is crucial for managing OTA updates effectively, ensuring compatibility and smooth transitions for users.

### Semantic Version Numbers

Capacitor uses a **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** format for semantic versioning. Each part has a distinct role:

| Version Component | When to Increment | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MAJOR** | For changes that break compatibility | 2.0.0 → 3.0.0 |
| **MINOR** | For adding new features that remain compatible | 2.1.0 → 2.2.0 |
| **PATCH** | For fixing bugs without breaking compatibility | 2.1.1 → 2.1.2 |

This structure ensures updates are distributed accurately and efficiently.

### Setup and Configuration

Follow these steps to set up version targeting in your Capacitor project:

1\. **Initial Setup**

Run `npx @capgo/cli init` in your project directory. This initializes the tools needed for OTA updates.

2\. **Version Configuration**

Define version parameters in your Capacitor configuration file. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "appId": "com.example.app",
  "appName": "MyApp",
  "versionName": "2.1.0",
  "versionCode": 21
}
```

3\. **Build Process**

Once configured, build your app as usual. The version targeting system will handle update distribution based on these settings.

These steps ensure your OTA updates are reliable and tailored to specific app versions.

> "With Capgo, you can launch multiple releases per week with an impressive 81% increase in efficiency." - Capgo [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

Capgo's system has delivered nearly 947.6 million updates globally, supporting over 1,400 production apps [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/). This showcases the reliability of version-targeted OTA updates.

Updates are applied in the background, minimizing user disruption - an effective approach for managing multiple app versions.

## When to Use Version Targeting

Version targeting helps manage updates across different user groups, ensuring app stability and a better user experience.

### Key Use Cases

Here’s when version targeting can be particularly useful:

| Scenario | Implementation | Benefits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Critical Bug Fixes | Focus updates on versions with the bug | Limits impact on users without the issue |
| Feature Rollouts | Gradually release features to newer versions | Allows careful monitoring and testing |
| Legacy Support | Keep older versions compatible | Ensures all users can continue using the app |
| Beta Testing | Target updates to specific version groups | Creates a controlled testing environment |

Let’s break down the specific advantages this approach offers.

### Main Advantages

Version targeting provides clear benefits for both developers and users:

**Better Stability**

-   Minimizes crashes by ensuring updates are compatible with specific versions.
    
-   Allows quick rollbacks if something goes wrong.
    
-   Keeps app performance consistent across different versions.
    

**Streamlined Development Process**

-   Gives teams precise control over how updates are distributed.
    
-   Speeds up bug fixes for specific versions.
    
-   Lowers the risks tied to launching new features.
    

**Enhanced User Experience**

By delivering only relevant updates, users avoid unnecessary changes. Developer Andrew Peacock highlights its impact:

> "With Capgo, we can push live code changes on our schedule, ensuring that our users always have the latest features and fixes without the long wait" [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

This approach is particularly effective in enterprise settings where multiple app versions need to coexist. It also ties in seamlessly with earlier discussions on technical setup, showing how tailored OTA updates can make a real difference.

## Implementation Guidelines

Now that you’ve got the technical foundation covered, it’s time to plan and execute your [update strategy](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/hybrid-update) effectively.

### Planning Your Update Strategy

To ensure smooth version targeting, it’s important to establish clear policies. The Capgo team suggests focusing on three main components:

| Component | Purpose | How to Implement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Version Categories** | Define update types | Use semantic versioning (major.minor.patch) |
| **Release Schedule** | Plan update frequency | Set consistent intervals but stay flexible for urgent fixes |
| **Testing Protocol** | Ensure update stability | Test thoroughly across targeted version ranges before releasing |

Once your strategy is in place, make sure to steer clear of common mistakes that can disrupt your deployment.

### Common Errors to Avoid

Development teams often run into issues when managing version targeting. Here are a few pitfalls to watch out for:

-   **Insufficient Testing Coverage**  
    Always test updates across all targeted versions to avoid overlooked issues.
    
-   **Poor Version Control**  
    Maintain strict version documentation and define clear compatibility boundaries.
    
-   **Lack of Communication**  
    Keep users updated about version requirements and upcoming changes to minimize confusion.
    

### Maintaining Old Versions

Supporting older versions is just as important as rolling out new ones. Here’s how you can manage this effectively while ensuring backward compatibility:

-   **Feature Flags**
    
    -   Control which features are available in specific versions.
        
    -   Gradually roll out updates to targeted version groups.
        
    -   Quickly disable features if they cause problems.
        
-   **Version-Specific Testing**
    
    -   Set up dedicated testing environments for each supported version.
        
    -   Verify that updates don’t interfere with existing functionality while introducing new features for compatible versions.
        
-   **Comprehensive Documentation**
    
    -   Maintain detailed documentation for each version, including API changes, configuration needs, and any known limitations.

## Fix Version Targeting Issues

Version targeting in [Capacitor OTA updates](https://capgo.app/ja/) can sometimes create challenges that disrupt functionality. Below are steps to help identify and address these problems effectively.

### Known Issues

Here are some common problems that can arise during OTA deployments:

| **Issue Type** | **Common Causes** | **Impact** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Version Mismatch | Incorrect use of SemVer | Updates fail to apply |
| Configuration Errors | Misaligned app settings | Deployment issues |
| Network Problems | Unstable connections | Incomplete updates |

These issues can negatively affect app performance and the user experience.

### Problem-Solving Steps

To fix version targeting issues, follow these steps:

1.  **Verify Version Configuration**  
    Check your app's configuration files to ensure version numbers use the SemVer format (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) correctly. Confirm consistency across all deployment environments.
    
2.  **Run Diagnostics**  
    Test across targeted app versions to identify compatibility problems. Use tools like Capgo's CLI diagnostics for quick troubleshooting.
    
3.  **Review Implementation**  
    Look into your update strategy, considering factors like network reliability during updates, device compatibility, and storage limitations.
