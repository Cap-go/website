**Looking for fast, reliable ways to reverse problematic app updates?** Here's the key takeaway: Platforms like [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) make rollbacks simple with one-click solutions, strong encryption, and CI/CD integration, while others like [Appflow](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow) and [Capawesome](https://capawesome.io/) have limitations or higher costs. [Microsoft CodePush](https://microsoft.github.io/code-push/), once a free option, was discontinued in 2024.

### Key Points:

-   **Capgo**: Affordable ($300/month + $2,600 setup), one-click rollback, GitHub/GitLab integration, real-time analytics, and encryption.
-   **Capawesome**: Limited documentation; region-specific (Germany).
-   **Appflow**: Expensive ($6,000/year); supports snapshots but ends in 2026.
-   **Microsoft CodePush**: Discontinued in 2024, leaving hybrid app developers seeking alternatives.

### Quick Comparison:

| Feature | Capgo | Capawesome | Appflow | Microsoft CodePush |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rollback Options | One-click rollback | Not documented | Snapshots | Discontinued |
| CI/CD Integration | GitHub, GitLab, [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) | Not documented | Limited | None |
| Security | End-to-end encryption | Update signing | Update signing | Update signing |
| Pricing | $300/month + $2,600 setup | Not disclosed | $6,000/year | Free (discontinued) |

**Bottom Line:** With CodePush gone and Appflow nearing its end, **Capgo** stands out as a cost-effective, secure, and feature-rich solution for rollback management.

## 1\. [Capgo](https://capgo.app/)

![Capgo](https://assets.seobotai.com/capgo.app/6806ece2e572faef86999f28/3963f7973abbc5791f2fae6e45924907.jpg)

Capgo speeds up CI/CD processes by offering a simple one-click rollback feature that integrates smoothly with existing pipelines. This rollback functionality allows teams to quickly restore previous releases, protecting live apps from extended downtime.

### Security and Performance

Capgo ensures data protection with end-to-end encryption and delivers fast performance, boasting an average API response time of 434 ms [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

### CI/CD Integration

It works seamlessly with popular tools like **[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions)**, **[GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)**, and **Jenkins**.

### Advanced Distribution Features

-   Roll out updates to specific user groups for beta testing
-   Deploy updates gradually using segmented rollouts
-   Detect errors in real time with built-in tracking
-   Monitor live app performance through detailed analytics

### Pricing

Capgo costs approximately $300 per month, with a one-time setup fee of $2,600 [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

### Update Management

Capgo supports partial updates to reduce bandwidth usage and is compatible with Capacitor versions 6 and 7. Users can choose between cloud-hosted or self-hosted setups.

By combining fast rollback capabilities with real-time analytics and error tracking, Capgo enables teams to address production issues quickly and maintain smooth delivery cycles. Up next, we'll explore how Capgo's rollback method compares to Capawesome's region-specific approach.

## 2\. [Capawesome](https://capawesome.io/)

![Capawesome](https://assets.seobotai.com/capgo.app/6806ece2e572faef86999f28/04d155e1ac5e3041660c0e8da59e2e54.jpg)

Capawesome's rollback features aren't well-documented or widely discussed, making their functionality uncertain. Up next, let's take a closer look at how Appflow handles rollbacks with its advanced enterprise framework.

## 3\. [Appflow](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow)

![Appflow](https://assets.seobotai.com/capgo.app/6806ece2e572faef86999f28/e3b5a6ca6da391fe9a61210f3bd95bb8.jpg)

Appflow charges approximately $6,000 per year for its CI/CD plan, leading many teams to explore more affordable rollback options. One of its key features is the ability to create release snapshots, allowing developers to quickly revert to any previous build when needed.

Developer Simon Flack shared his experience:

> "We are currently giving a try to @Capgo since Appcenter stopped live updates support on hybrid apps and @AppFlow is way too expensive." [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

Up next, weâ€™ll take a look at how Microsoft CodePush handles rollbacks.

## 4\. [Microsoft CodePush](https://microsoft.github.io/code-push/)

![Microsoft CodePush](https://assets.seobotai.com/capgo.app/6806ece2e572faef86999f28/edac23070781a219bf38bb37f0451a0f.jpg)

Microsoft CodePush was a free CI/CD rollback tool designed for hybrid apps, but itâ€™s shutting down in 2024. This closure has left hybrid app teams searching for alternatives. After its retirement, developers have been looking for tools that provide dependable hybrid app support, smooth CI/CD integration, one-click rollback features, and secure end-to-end encryption. Platforms like Capgo have stepped in to fill these needs, offering encrypted updates and easy restore options. Letâ€™s take a closer look at how these rollback tools compare.

## Platform Comparison

Here's a breakdown of rollback features, CI/CD integration, security, and pricing for four platforms:

| Feature | Capgo | Capawesome | Appflow | Microsoft CodePush |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rollback Options | One-click rollback to any previous version [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/) | â€“   | â€“   | Discontinued |
| CI/CD Integration | GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/) | â€“   | â€“   | â€“   |
| Security | End-to-end encryption (meets Apple and Google requirements) [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/) | Update signing | Update signing | Update signing |
| Pricing Model | Starts at $12/month (Solo plan); $2,600 one-time setup + ~$300/month for CI/CD [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/) | â€“   | $6,000/year [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/) | Free (discontinued) |

This comparison emphasizes Capgo's strengths in cost, security, and CI/CD integration.

> "@Capgo is a smart way to make hot code pushes (and not for all the money in the world like with @AppFlow) ðŸ™‚" - NASA's OSIRISâ€‘REx [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

Capgo stands out by offering a more affordable option compared to Appflow, with over 50% savings on annual costs. The combination of a $2,600 setup fee and ~$300/month provides end-to-end encryption, GitHub/GitLab/Jenkins integration, and live analytics - features that competitors lack.

Next, we'll summarize the key takeaways from this comparison.

## Conclusion

After evaluating rollback features, security, integration, and cost, hereâ€™s what development teams in the US should keep in mind.

With Microsoft CodePush set to retire in 2024 and Appflow wrapping up in 2026, finding a reliable CI/CD rollback solution is critical for developers.

Key factors to consider include **end-to-end encryption** for Apple and Android platforms, **native support for GitHub/GitLab CI**, a balance between setup effort and subscription costs, and **clear rollback metrics**.

Platforms that combine strong encryption with seamless CI/CD integration are leading the pack. Among them, Capgo stands out for its secure updates, smooth integration, and budget-friendly approach.
