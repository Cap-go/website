What a year. As 2025 comes to a close, we're looking back at twelve months that completely transformed Capgo from a solid OTA update platform into the comprehensive Capacitor ecosystem you rely on today.

The numbers tell part of the story: **58 new Capacitor plugins** created, growing our catalog from 20 to 78 plugins (that's 290% growth). Enterprise security features that make Capgo ready for the most demanding organizations. A global infrastructure spanning 7+ regions with automatic failover.

But the real story is what these changes mean for you: faster development, better security, and plugins for nearly every use case you can imagine.

Let's walk through how 2025 unfolded.

## Q1: The Foundation - Streamcall Development Begins

**Q1 2025** marked the beginning of something special. We started development on [capacitor-streamcall](https://github.com/Cap-go/capacitor-streamcall), what would become our flagship plugin of the year - a complete video calling SDK integration for Capacitor.

This wasn't just another plugin. Streamcall would receive continuous development and improvements throughout the entire year. By December, it had shipped over 90 releases and upgraded to Capacitor 8 support. But in Q1, we were just laying the groundwork.

**Q1 Plugin Count:** 1 new plugin (in development)

The foundation was set. Little did we know what was coming.

## Q2: Expansion Begins

**April through June** saw the plugin ecosystem start to expand. Six new plugins joined the catalog, each solving real problems developers face:

- **capacitor-llm** (June) - Run large language models locally on iOS and Android with Apple Intelligence support
- **capacitor-jw-player** (April) - Native video playback with JW Player SDK
- **capacitor-appinsights** (June) - Azure App Insights integration
- **capacitor-android-usagestatsmanager** (April) - Track app usage stats natively on Android
- **capacitor-autofill-save-password** (May) - iOS keychain password saving

The AI wave was hitting mobile, and we were ready with local LLM support. Video processing moved to the edge. Developer tooling got smarter.

**Q2 Plugin Count:** 5 new plugins

## Q3: The Acceleration

**July through September** is when things really started to take off. But before we get to the plugin numbers, let's talk about the biggest enterprise milestone of the year:

### Team Growth: Building the Foundation

**Jordan Joins (July)**

In July 2025, **Jordan joined the Capgo team** as an experienced developer. Jordan previously worked with Martin at [Toucan Toco](https://www.toucantoco.com/en/), bringing deep expertise in building complex projects and features.

Jordan's impact was immediate. Throughout Q3 and Q4, he architected and built several critical systems, including the **usage credits system** (launched December 9) that now powers Capgo's billing infrastructure. His expertise in complex feature development became a cornerstone of our Q4 enterprise push.

**Valeria Joins (September)**

September brought a different kind of growth challenge: major applications with over 5 million users were adopting Capgo. These weren't just regular customers - they were enterprise clients needing dedicated support, complex deployment strategies, and relationship management at scale.

**Valeria (Lera) joined as Project & Success Manager**, bringing order to what was becoming chaotic growth. She created onboarding playbooks, established support processes, and most importantly, ensured our biggest clients felt heard and supported. With Valeria managing enterprise relationships, the team could focus on building while knowing our largest customers were in excellent hands.

### SOC 2 Type II Certified (July 16)

![SOC 2 Type II Certification](/soc2.svg)

On July 16, 2025, Capgo achieved **SOC 2 Type II certification**. This isn't just a badge on our website - it's proof that our security controls, data handling, and operational practices meet the strictest standards that enterprise security teams demand.

For context: SOC 2 certification means independent auditors examined our entire infrastructure, security practices, and operational procedures over an extended period. They verified we're doing everything right - access controls, encryption, monitoring, incident response, data protection, the works.

This opened doors. Enterprise teams that couldn't even consider Capgo before July could now move forward. Security questionnaires got easier. Procurement processes sped up. IT departments gave the green light.

SOC 2 wasn't just certification - it was validation that Capgo is ready for production at any scale.

### Q3 Plugin Expansion

With that foundation in place, the plugin development pace doubled with 12 new plugins released:

**Enterprise Integrations:**
- **capacitor-twilio-voice** - Production-grade voice calling with Twilio
- **capacitor-gtm** - Google Tag Manager for native analytics

**Health & Fitness:**
- **capacitor-health** - Apple HealthKit and Google Fit data access
- **capacitor-background-geolocation** - Accurate location tracking in background

**Media & Streaming:**
- **capacitor-mux-player** - Mux Player SDK for iOS and Android
- **capacitor-audiosession** - Advanced audio session management

**Developer Tools:**
- **capacitor-persistent-account** - Persist account data between installs
- **capacitor-android-inline-install** - Trigger Android inline install feature
- **capacitor-alarm** - Native alarm functionality
- **capacitor-launch-navigator** - Route navigation integration
- **capacitor-is-root** - Jailbreak and root detection
- **capacitor-textinteraction** - iOS text interaction controls

The focus was clear: enterprise integrations for serious apps, health and fitness capabilities, and developer experience improvements.

**Q3 Plugin Count:** 12 new plugins

### The Human Side: Team Madeira (August)

Behind all these features, plugins, and certifications are real people. In August 2025, the Capgo team met in person in Madeira, Portugal - and it was truly special.

Jordan, Michael, and Martin (our CEO) spent a week working together, exploring the island, and building the relationships that make everything else possible. Some moments from that week:

And because no team trip is complete without karaoke in a Tesla:

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <video controls style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;">
    <source src="/capgo_madera_signing_web.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>
</div>

*Impromptu Tesla karaoke - one of my favorite memories from the trip*

This wasn't just a team retreat. It was the week where we talked through the enterprise features that would launch in Q4. Where we planned the plugin explosion. Where we became more than colleagues - we became a team that truly trusts each other.

The SOC 2 certification? The 40 Q4 plugins? The enterprise features? They all happened because of the foundation built during this week in Madeira.

### Camera Preview Complete Rewrite (August 21)

One of the most ambitious technical projects of 2025 happened in August: a **complete rewrite of capacitor-camera-preview**. This wasn't just an update - it was a ground-up rebuild.

The massive PR ([#205](https://github.com/Cap-go/capacitor-camera-preview/pull/205)) included:
- **193 commits** across 170 files
- Complete Android migration to **CameraX** API
- iOS rebuild using **AVFoundation**
- New web video pipeline

**New capabilities added:**
- Multi-lens and device discovery
- Zoom, focus, and flash controls
- Aspect ratio and grid overlays
- EXIF and GPS embedding
- Video recording support
- Safe area and orientation handling

This level of rewrite - 41,000+ lines of code changed - demonstrated our commitment to maintaining best-in-class plugins. When Android deprecated the old Camera API, we didn't just patch it. We rebuilt the entire plugin with modern APIs and expanded functionality.

## Q4: The Explosion

- And many more...

On December 13, we upgraded capacitor-streamcall to v8.0, bringing full Capacitor 8 support to our flagship video calling plugin.

**Q4 Plugin Count:** 40 new plugins

## Q4: Platform Goes Enterprise

While the plugin ecosystem exploded, we didn't neglect the core platform. December 2025 brought a wave of enterprise-grade security features that transformed Capgo into a platform ready for Fortune 500 companies.

### Security & Access Control

**SAML SSO with Auto-Join** (December 28)
Enterprise teams can now use their existing identity providers with domain-based auto-provisioning. When users from verified domains log in, they're automatically added to the right organization. No manual user management needed.

**Two-Factor Authentication Enforcement** (December 24-28)
Organization admins can now require 2FA for all members. Before enforcement, you get a preview showing which team members would be affected. App-level 2FA enforcement ensures only verified users can access your apps.

**Hashed API Keys with Security Policies** (December 28)
API keys are now only visible once after creation - just like GitHub or AWS. Organizations can enforce this policy across all members and reject plain-text keys. Your keys are hashed and secure.

**API Key Expiration & Lifecycle Management** (December 28)
Set expiration dates on API keys. Organizations can enforce maximum validity periods. Keys automatically delete after a 30-day grace period. Clear error messages when keys expire. No more forgotten, permanent API keys floating around.

**Organization Password Policies** (December 28)
Configure password complexity requirements at the organization level. Track compliance. Enforce security standards across your entire team.

### Automation & Integration

**Webhooks System** (December 27)
Subscribe to events across your apps, channels, and devices. Delivery history tracking shows exactly what was sent and when. HMAC-SHA256 signatures ensure webhook authenticity. Build custom automations and integrations with your existing tools.

### Developer Experience

**Granular Email Notification Preferences** (December 28)
Nine different notification types, each customizable per user. Usage alerts, stats updates, bundle notifications, device errors - control exactly what you want to hear about. Available in 14 languages: German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (BR), Russian, Turkish, Vietnamese, and Chinese.

**Native Dependencies Tracking** (December 4)
A new "Native Dependencies" tab in bundle details shows exactly which native packages and versions are in each build. Direct npm links for every dependency. No more guessing what's in production.

**CLI Version Tracking** (December 19)
Every bundle now records which CLI version uploaded it. Visible in your dashboard. When users report issues, you know exactly which tooling they used.

**Encryption Key Validation** (December 13)
20-character public key prefixes identify which encryption key is in use. Automatic mismatch detection prevents updates from going to devices with wrong keys. Your encrypted bundles stay secure.

**Usage Credits System** (December 9)
Jordan architected and built our complete credit-based billing infrastructure. Credit top-up functionality with automatic overage handling. Alerts at 50%, 75%, 90%, and 100% usage. Complete transaction tracking. Know exactly where you stand before hitting limits.

**Enhanced Channel Management** (December 31)
Channel ID and device ID now included in all request payloads. Better tracking, better analytics, easier debugging when issues arise.

### Developer Infrastructure Revolution

**Capgo Cloud Build** (November 19)
We launched a game-changing feature: **build native apps directly in the cloud without Xcode or Android Studio**. Built on 3 years of internal expertise, Capgo Cloud Build lets you run a single CLI command to build iOS and Android apps on dedicated infrastructure.

Key capabilities:
- **One-command builds** - No local Xcode (30+ GB) or Android Studio required
- **Cross-platform builds** - Build iOS apps from Linux/Windows, eliminating the Mac requirement
- **Battle-tested infrastructure** - Using the same system we've relied on for thousands of internal builds
- **Real-time log streaming** - Watch your builds happen with instant terminal feedback
- **Direct App Store submission** - Build and submit to TestFlight or Play Store in one step
- **Secure credential handling** - Credentials stored locally, never on our servers

This is like Expo EAS Build, but specifically optimized for Capacitor. After years of building apps for clients, we made our proven infrastructure available to everyone.

### Infrastructure & Reliability

**Capacitor 8 Support** (December 2025)
Full compatibility with Capacitor 8. Node.js 24 support in build workflows. Modern tooling integration across the board.

**PostgreSQL 17 Compatibility** (December 29)
Migrated to PostgreSQL 17's built-in `gen_random_uuid()`. Removed deprecated uuid-ossp extension. Future-proof database layer ready for years to come.

**Circuit Breaker Pattern for Regional Failover** (December 30)
Automatic health checks for regional servers. When a region has issues, traffic instantly routes to healthy backup regions. Five-minute recovery window with automatic retry. Better uptime, better user experience.

**Chunk Load Error Handling** (December 24)
When users hit loading failures, they now get automatic update notifications. Better error recovery. Fewer frustrated users.

## By The Numbers

Let's look at what 2025 meant in hard data:

**Plugin Ecosystem:**
- **59 new Capacitor plugins created**
  - Q1: 1 plugin
  - Q2: 6 plugins
  - Q3: 12 plugins
  - Q4: 40 plugins
- **Plugin catalog grew 295%** (from ~20 to ~79 total plugins)
- **capacitor-streamcall:** 10+ months of active development, 90+ releases

**Platform Evolution:**
- **SOC 2 Type II certified** (July 16) - enterprise-ready security validation
- **16 major features** launched in Q4 alone
- **Platform versions:** v12.70 → v12.83 (continuous iteration)
- **7+ global database regions** for low-latency access worldwide
- **14 languages** supported for email notifications
- **Enterprise-grade security** features ready for Fortune 500

## What It All Means

2025 wasn't just about adding features. It was about transformation.

### 1. Plugin Ecosystem Explosion

We became the go-to source for Capacitor plugins. Whether you need video calling (streamcall), AI capabilities (LLM), payment processing (pay), IoT integration (NFC, Bluetooth, iBeacon), health data (health, pedometer), or any of dozens of other capabilities - we've got you covered.

The Q4 acceleration shows this momentum isn't slowing down. Developers are building serious production apps with Capacitor, and they need serious tooling. We're delivering it.

### 2. Enterprise-Ready Platform

**SOC 2 Type II certification in July** set the foundation. Then came SAML SSO, 2FA enforcement, hashed API keys with expiration, password policies, webhooks, and audit logging in Q4.

These aren't just buzzword features. They're the requirements that enterprise security teams demand before approving any platform. The SOC 2 certification proved we meet those standards. The Q4 features gave you the tools to enforce them.

Now Capgo checks every box on the enterprise security checklist.

### 3. Global Infrastructure

Seven-plus database regions. Circuit breaker patterns. Automatic failover. 14-language support.

Your users are everywhere. Your infrastructure should be too. Whether your customers are in Tokyo, Mumbai, São Paulo, or San Francisco - Capgo delivers fast, reliable updates.

### 4. Developer Experience

CLI version tracking. Native dependencies visibility. Encryption key validation. Usage credits with alerts. Granular notifications.

We know you're shipping fast and need visibility when things go wrong. Every feature we built in 2025 was designed to give you the information you need, when you need it.

## Looking Ahead

We're not slowing down. The plugin ecosystem momentum continues. Enterprise features mature. Infrastructure expands.

But we don't want to make promises about timelines. What we will say: 2026 will build on everything we achieved in 2025. More plugins. Deeper enterprise integration. Better developer tools. Faster infrastructure.

Most importantly: we're listening. The features we built in 2025 came directly from what you told us you needed. That won't change.

## Thank You

To everyone who shipped an app with Capgo in 2025, filed an issue, requested a feature, or just believed in what we're building - thank you.

The plugin ecosystem exists because developers needed solutions and we delivered. The enterprise features exist because teams trusted us with their production apps. The global infrastructure exists because your users deserve the best.

Here's to 2025. And here's to what we'll build together in 2026.

**Want to try the new enterprise features?** Check out [our documentation](https://capgo.app/docs/) or reach out to our team.

**Need a plugin that doesn't exist yet?** [Let us know](https://github.com/Cap-go/capgo/issues) - 2025 proved we can move fast.
