**Want faster [app updates](https://capgo.app/plugins/capacitor-updater/) without the wait?** Over-the-Air (OTA) updates let developers bypass app store delays and push changes directly to users within minutes. Here's why this matters:

-   **Speed**: OTA updates reach 95% of users within 24 hours, compared to the 2–7 day review cycle for app store updates.
-   **Flexibility**: Roll out targeted updates, fix bugs, or deploy features without requiring user action.
-   **Efficiency**: Only modified code is downloaded, saving bandwidth and time.

**Quick Comparison**:

| Feature | App Store Updates | OTA Updates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Deployment Time** | Days to weeks | Minutes to hours |
| **User Adoption** | Gradual | 95% within 24 hours |
| **Rollback Capability** | Requires resubmission | Instant rollback |
| **Bandwidth Usage** | Full app download | Only changed content |

OTA updates, like those powered by [Capgo](https://capgo.app/), ensure faster, seamless updates while staying compliant with app store rules. Whether you're fixing bugs, improving security, or adding features, OTA updates are a game-changer for agile app development.

## App Store Update Limits

App stores place strict limits on app updates, making it challenging to roll out changes quickly. These restrictions highlight the importance of finding faster solutions like OTA (Over-the-Air) updates. The detailed review processes required by major platforms often delay the release of updates.

### Code Update Restrictions

Both Apple and Google enforce rigorous review procedures, which can slow down even the smallest updates. While app store updates may take several days to reach users, OTA updates can be deployed within minutes. According to Capgo, this speed difference is a game-changer [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

### Why These Rules Exist

App stores enforce these rules to safeguard users and maintain the overall stability of their platforms. Here's why:

-   **Security Checks**: Reviews help block malicious code from being added to apps.
-   **Quality Control**: Updates are thoroughly tested to ensure they meet platform standards.
-   **System Stability**: Careful oversight ensures updates don't disrupt the platform's functionality.

Because of these controls, developers are turning to alternative methods to keep up with the need for faster updates. Capgo, for example, has delivered 23.5 million OTA updates that comply with app store rules [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/), proving the demand for quicker solutions.

> "We rolled out [Capgo OTA updates](https://web.capgo.app/resend_email) in production for our user base of +5000. We're seeing very smooth operation almost all our users are up to date within minutes of the OTA being deployed to @Capgo." - colenso [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

Modern OTA systems provide a way to push critical updates quickly without breaking app store guidelines. This approach demonstrates how developers can achieve faster deployment while staying compliant. Up next, we'll dive deeper into how OTA updates offer this agility.

## How [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) OTA Updates Work

![Capacitor](https://mars-images.imgix.net/seobot/screenshots/capacitorjs.com-4c1a6a7e452082d30f5bff9840b00b7d-2025-03-19.jpg?auto=compress)

[Capacitor OTA updates](https://capgo.app/ja/) make app deployment faster and more efficient, allowing developers to push changes without waiting for app store approvals.

### How OTA Updates Work

A plugin handles the detection and installation of updates. When developers deploy updates using the CLI, the app automatically identifies and installs them in the background. Instead of downloading everything, only the modified code is retrieved, saving bandwidth and speeding up the process. For example, Capgo's global CDN can deliver a 5 MB bundle in just 114 ms, with an average API response time of 434 ms globally [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/). This streamlined approach ensures updates are quick and hassle-free.

### Benefits of OTA Updates

OTA updates bring more than just speed - they give developers better control over their [update process](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/manual-update/). Here's a quick breakdown:

| Feature | Benefit | Key Metric |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Update Speed | Faster deployment | 95% of users updated within 24 hours |
| Distribution Control | Targeted rollouts | 82% success rate globally |
| Resource Efficiency | Smaller downloads | 114 ms for a 5 MB bundle |
| Reliability | Automatic rollback | 23.5M updates delivered |

### [Capgo](https://capgo.app/)'s OTA Tools

Currently, 750 apps rely on Capgo's system in production environments [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/). These tools combine speed, security, and reliability, making OTA updates a smart choice for developers who want to stay agile while meeting app store guidelines.

## OTA vs App Store Updates

OTA (Over-the-Air) updates and app store updates differ greatly in terms of speed, ease of deployment, and user experience. OTA updates provide a faster and more flexible way to deliver changes, particularly for teams working with agile methodologies.

### Feature Comparison

Here's a breakdown of the key differences between app store updates and OTA updates, showing why many developers are turning to OTA solutions:

| Feature | App Store Updates | Capacitor OTA Updates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Deployment Time** | 2–7 days review process | Minutes to hours |
| **Update Success Rate** | Depends on user action | 95% within 24 hours |
| **Distribution Control** | Limited targeting options | Channel-based targeting |
| **Rollback Capability** | Requires new submission | Instant rollback |
| **User Interaction** | [Manual update approval](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/manual-update/) | [Automatic background updates](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/self-hosted/auto-update/) |

Real-world cases demonstrate how OTA updates improve efficiency. For example, Rodrigo Mantica highlights their value in enterprise settings:

> "We practice agile development and @Capgo is mission-critical in delivering continuously to our users!" [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

The numbers back this up: OTA updates boast an 82% global success rate and have delivered 23.5 million updates [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/). These stats underline their reliability and scalability compared to traditional app store updates.

While app store updates are still essential for major releases and significant new features, OTA updates provide a faster, more efficient way to handle regular updates. They allow developers to keep their apps compliant while ensuring a smooth and seamless update process for users.

Up next, we’ll cover how to implement OTA updates while meeting app store requirements.

## OTA Update Implementation Guide

### Meeting Store Requirements

To implement OTA updates successfully, you need to meet app store guidelines. Here are the key areas to focus on:

-   **Channel-Based Distribution**: Use various channels to run staged rollouts and beta testing effectively.
-   **Version Control Management**: Maintain strict version tracking and integrate OTA updates into your CI/CD pipeline.
-   **[Update Size Optimization](https://capgo.app/blog/optimise-your-images-for-updates/)**: Minimize download sizes by sending only the modified code.

These steps are crucial for delivering secure and dependable OTA updates.

### Security and Trust

Once the deployment process is set up, prioritizing security and building user trust is critical. Capgo employs end-to-end encryption, ensuring updates are accessible only to authorized users. This method has achieved an 82% global success rate across 750 production apps [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/). Here are the main security measures:

-   End-to-end encryption for all update files
-   Real-time error tracking and monitoring
-   Instant rollback options to address issues quickly
-   Stringent authentication and authorization protocols

### Real Update Examples

Practical applications validate these strategies. For instance, NASA's [OSIRIS-REx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSIRIS-REx) team highlighted their experience:

> "Capgo is a smart way to make hot code pushes (and not for all the money in the world like with @AppFlow) :-)" [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

These examples show how well-executed OTA updates can enable fast deployments, remain app store-compliant, and preserve user trust.
