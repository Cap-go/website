## Code Verification Methods

[Capacitor apps](https://capgo.app/blog/capacitor-comprehensive-guide/) combine web and native verification techniques to secure code using digital signatures and encryption.

### Digital Signatures and Encryption

Code verification relies on cryptographic methods. Using **asymmetric cryptography**, developers sign code bundles with private keys, and client devices verify them with public keys. This process often pairs **SHA-256 hashing** for verifying content integrity with **AES-256 encryption** to secure sensitive configurations.

| Verification Layer | Implementation | Security Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bundle Signing | SHA-256 + JWT tokens | High |
| Data Transport | TLS/SSL | High |
| Config Protection | AES-256 encryption | High |
| Runtime Checks | Hash verification | High |

### Platform Security APIs

Capacitor builds on its native security features by leveraging platform-specific APIs. For Android, the `@capacitor-community/play-integrity` plugin [\[2\]](https://github.com/capacitor-community/play-integrity/) adds extra layers of verification. The setup includes:

1.  Generating cryptographic challenge tokens (16+ bytes).
2.  Configuring the Play Integrity API with a [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) Project ID.
3.  Managing critical errors like API failures (-1), missing services (-2), or invalid tokens.

This system performs three key checks:

-   Verifies app authenticity.
-   Assesses device integrity.
-   Confirms license validation status.

### Combined Web and Native Checks

A hybrid approach enhances Capacitor's protections by integrating **Content Security Policies (CSP)** for web content with tools like [Free-RASP-Capacitor](https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-Capacitor) [\[3\]](https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-Capacitor).

For production environments, developers should implement:

-   Startup checksum validation.
-   Real-time monitoring for code modifications.
-   Encrypted validation for partial updates.

These measures ensure compliance with platform update requirements while maintaining strong security protocols.

## App Store Rules and Requirements

App stores enforce strict guidelines for OTA (Over-the-Air) updates to ensure user safety. Developers must follow these rules carefully to avoid issues during app deployment and updates.

### iOS and Android Guidelines

Both iOS and Android have specific requirements that align with Capacitor's native verification methods. For iOS, **App Store Review Guideline 3.1.2** governs OTA updates. While JavaScript updates are allowed under certain conditions, any functionality changes require prior approval.

Android focuses on the **Play Integrity API**, which provides a robust system for verifying app integrity. Here's a quick breakdown of the key requirements for each platform:

-   **iOS**:
    
    -   Adherence to App Store Guideline 3.1.2
    -   Tracking `CFBundleVersion`
    -   Use of code signing certificates
-   **Android**:
    
    -   Integration of the Play Integrity API
    -   Validation of tokens
    -   Consistent package naming

### Update Tracking for Compliance

Tracking updates effectively is essential for meeting app store requirements. It complements runtime integrity checks and provides a clear, auditable compliance record. Developers can maintain compliance by implementing the following:

| **Tracking Component** | **Implementation Method** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Version History | Cryptographically signed timestamps | Creates an audit trail |
| Deployment Logs | Append-only audit logs | Documents compliance |
| Verification Records | Token validation receipts | Confirms integrity |

Integrating these tracking methods with CI/CD pipelines strengthens both security and documentation. This approach ensures apps meet app store verification standards while maintaining detailed audit trails.
