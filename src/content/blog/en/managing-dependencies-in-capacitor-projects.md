## Types of Dependencies in [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/)

![Capacitor](https://mars-images.imgix.net/seobot/screenshots/capacitorjs.com-4c1a6a7e452082d30f5bff9840b00b7d-2025-02-24.jpg?auto=compress)

Capacitor projects rely on various dependencies, each playing a specific role in cross-platform development. Let’s break down plugins and platform-specific configurations.

### Working with Capacitor Plugins

[Capacitor plugins](https://capgo.app/plugins/) connect JavaScript to native features, providing a unified web API. Official plugins from the Capacitor team make integration straightforward.

For instance, if you’re adding camera functionality, the setup might look like this:

| Platform | Dependency Configuration |
| --- | --- |
| iOS | `CapacitorCamera` (Pod) |
| Android | `com.capacitorjs:camera` (Maven) |
| Web | `@capacitor/camera` (npm) |

> "Capacitor provides a consistent, web-focused set of APIs that enable an app to stay as close to web standards as possible, while accessing rich native device features on platforms that support them." - Capacitor Documentation [\[3\]](https://capacitorjs.com/docs)

### Platform-Specific Dependencies

For iOS, you’ll need [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) CLI, CocoaPods, and support for iOS 11 or later [\[2\]](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/v2/getting-started/dependencies).

On Android, make sure to use the Android SDK, [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro), and ensure compatibility with API level 21 or higher (Android 5.0 Lollipop), which covers most Android devices [\[2\]](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/v2/getting-started/dependencies).

iOS dependencies are managed through the Podfile and .podspec, while Android uses Gradle for configuration. For example, misconfigured MLKit dependencies on either platform can lead to errors, highlighting the importance of accurate setup [\[4\]](https://ionic.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037704753-Capacitor-Plugin-Development-Adding-iOS-podfile-dependencies).

## Step-by-Step Dependency Management

Here's how to handle dependencies and keep your project running smoothly.

### Installing New Dependencies

To add JavaScript dependencies, use npm or yarn, then sync your native projects with the Capacitor CLI:

-   Use `npm install` or `yarn add` to install the required package.
-   Run `npx cap sync` to update iOS and Android projects.
-   Open Xcode and Android Studio to verify native project settings.

If you're adding [NativeScript](https://nativescript.org/) functionality, follow these steps:

-   Run `npm install @nativescript/capacitor`.
-   Build mobile components with `npm run build:mobile`.
-   Sync updates using `npx cap sync` [\[5\]](https://capacitor.nativescript.org/installation.html).

### Updating Project Dependencies

Keep your core and platform dependencies up-to-date with these steps:

1.  **Core Dependencies**  
    Update Capacitor core packages in the `/src-capacitor/package.json` file. Here's an example of the required versions:
    
    | Package | Version |
    | --- | --- |
    | @capacitor/app | ^6.0.0 |
    | @capacitor/cli | ^6.0.0 |
    | @capacitor/core | ^6.0.0 |
    | @capacitor/splash-screen | ^6.0.0 |
    
2.  **Platform Updates**
    
    -   For Android, run: `npm install @capacitor/android@latest` [\[6\]](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/v2/android/updating).
    -   For iOS, execute: `pod repo update` [\[5\]](https://capacitor.nativescript.org/installation.html).

After updates, test your application on both platforms to ensure everything works as expected. Staying current reduces security risks and prevents technical debt.

### Common Dependency Problems and Solutions

Here are some common issues you might face and how to resolve them:

-   **Android Issues:**
    
    -   _"package android.support._ does not exist"\*: Run jetifier [\[8\]](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/android/troubleshooting).
    -   _"Please select Android SDK"_: Perform a Gradle sync [\[8\]](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/android/troubleshooting).
    -   Clear Android Studio caches and restart to apply pending changes [\[8\]](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/android/troubleshooting).
-   **iOS Issues:**
    
    -   Run `pod repo update` if sync fails.
    -   Clean the build folder in Xcode and restart.
    -   Confirm CocoaPods compatibility.
-   **Plugin Issues:**
    
    -   For _"Plugin Not Implemented"_ errors, check the sync status and ensure plugins load automatically [\[8\]](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/android/troubleshooting).
    -   If ProGuard is enabled, add rules to preserve plugin classes [\[8\]](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/android/troubleshooting).

## Dependency Management Guidelines

Managing dependencies effectively in Capacitor projects requires a structured approach with automation and thorough testing. Using the right tools and strategies ensures your project stays stable and up-to-date.

### Automation Tools for Dependencies

Automation tools can make managing dependencies much easier. For instance, **capacitor-build-safety** runs automated checks to catch unsynced Capacitor changes or missed web builds. This reduces deployment issues and keeps releases consistent across platforms [\[11\]](https://github.com/fkirc/capacitor-build-safety).

Another example is **capacitor-sync-version-cli**, which automates version synchronization and calculates Android's versionCode. This minimizes manual errors and keeps versions aligned [\[12\]](https://github.com/bjesuiter/capacitor-sync-version-cli).

Here's a quick comparison of key tools:

| Tool | Primary Function | Key Benefit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| capacitor-build-safety | Release safety checks | Avoids broken Android/iOS releases |
| capacitor-sync-version-cli | Version synchronization | Simplifies version management |
| npm audit | Security scanning | Detects vulnerabilities |
| Capgo/capacitor-updater | Live updates | Enables quick feature deployments |

### Documenting and Testing Dependencies

It's important to document and test dependencies as part of your workflow. Using **Dependency Injection (DI)** helps keep your code modular and easier to test [\[10\]](https://hackeryarn.com/post/universally-testable-dependencies/).

For testing Capacitor plugins, you can set up TypeScript path mapping. By creating a **mocks** directory and updating `tsconfig.spec.json` to map `@capacitor/*` to mock implementations, you can test components in a controlled environment [\[9\]](https://github.com/ionic-team/cap-plugin-mock-jasmine).

When dealing with dependency conflicts, especially with NPM 7 or later, follow this step-by-step process:

1.  **Assess the Situation**  
    Use `npm audit` to scan for vulnerabilities and log any issues [\[1\]](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/vscode/dependencies).
    
2.  **Resolve Conflicts**  
    Address peer dependency conflicts by upgrading dependencies iteratively until everything installs correctly [\[13\]](https://volt.build/news/2023/04/12/capacitor-and-npm-6.html).
    
3.  **Verify Updates**  
    After resolving issues, thoroughly test the updated dependencies. Use mocks for Capacitor plugins with testing frameworks like Jasmine [\[9\]](https://github.com/ionic-team/cap-plugin-mock-jasmine).
    

To make testing and maintenance easier in the long run, export your dependencies into a `deps` object. This simplifies mocking during tests and helps detect issues before they affect production environments [\[10\]](https://hackeryarn.com/post/universally-testable-dependencies/).
