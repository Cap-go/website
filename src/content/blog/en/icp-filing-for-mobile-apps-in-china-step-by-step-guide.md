If you want your mobile app to operate legally in China, you **must complete an ICP filing**. This is a mandatory registration process to ensure compliance with Chinese regulations. Here's a quick overview:

-   **What is ICP Filing?**  
    It's a registration system ("备案") required for internet-based services, including mobile apps, to legally operate in China.
    
-   **Why is it Required?**  
    Without it, your app risks fines, removal from platforms, and legal issues.
    
-   **Key Requirements:**  
    You'll need business licenses, domain registration, server details, and compliance documents. For foreign businesses, partnering with a local Chinese company is essential.
    
-   **Filing Process:**
    
    1.  Choose a licensed provider (e.g., [Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/services/icp?_p_lc=1), [Tencent Cloud](https://www.tencentcloud.com/solutions/icp-registration-support)).
    2.  Submit required documents (translated into Chinese).
    3.  Wait for approval (14–23 business days on average).
-   **Post-Approval:**  
    Display your ICP number prominently in your app and keep all details updated.
    

Skipping this process can lead to significant disruptions, so ensure you're fully prepared before launching in China.

## Required Documentation

Getting your ICP filing right in China starts with having the correct paperwork. Here's a breakdown of the business, technical, and authorization documents you'll need.

### Document Checklist

Make sure to gather these documents before starting your filing process:

-   **Business Documentation**
    
    -   Business license or company registration certificate
    -   Organization code certificate
    -   Legal representative's ID (passport for foreign representatives)
    -   Official company seal (company chop)
    -   Proof of a local Chinese business address
-   **Technical Documentation**
    
    -   Domain name registration certificate
    -   Server hosting details
    -   Network security protocol documentation
    -   Statement on data privacy compliance
    -   Emergency response plan
-   **Authorization Documents**
    
    -   Authorization letter (if working with an agent)
    -   Power of attorney (for foreign companies)
    -   Appointment letter for a local representative

### Platform-Specific Technical Information

While iOS and Android share similar requirements, you'll need to provide detailed technical information about your app. This includes the app identifier, store URLs, server IPs, content security measures, and update mechanisms. Adhering to app store rules in China is critical for updates [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/). Tools like Capgo can help you manage compliant, live updates.

**Key Technical Tips:**

-   Keep all documents saved as PDFs.
-   Translate any English documents into Chinese.
-   Prepare separate files for each app version.
-   Back up all certificates and keys.
-   Document your app's network architecture and data flow for security reviews.

Having these documents in order ensures you meet regulatory requirements and helps maintain your app's compliance and update processes. Once everything is ready, you can move on to the filing steps.

## Filing Application Steps

Here's how to file your ICP application step by step.

Once you have all your documentation ready, the next move is to pick the right filing partner.

### Choose a Service Provider

You can choose from the following types of providers:

-   **Licensed Internet Service Providers (ISPs):** Well-known options include Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud, or [China Telecom](https://www.ctamericas.com/icp-license-support/).
-   **Third-party filing agencies:** These companies specialize in ICP registration services.
-   **Hosting providers:** These combine hosting services with ICP filing assistance.

Look for a provider with a strong track record in ICP filings, reliable Chinese language support, fast responses, and transparent pricing.

### Submit Your Application

**Initial Registration:** Start by registering on your provider's platform. You'll need to submit details such as company verification, legal representative information, app specifics, and server configurations.

Make sure to complete the forms carefully, including:

-   Details about your app's functionality and purpose.
-   Information on server locations and configurations.
-   Methods for content distribution.
-   Procedures for handling data.

Required documents must be uploaded according to the format specified, and signatures and stamps should be in red ink.

### Expected Timeline

| Stage | Duration | Key Activities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initial Review | 1-3 business days | Provider checks document completeness |
| Provincial Filing | 10-15 business days | Local authority review |
| Final Verification | 3-5 business days | ICP number assignment |
| Total Process | 14-23 business days | From submission to approval |

-   Applications submitted during Chinese holidays may take longer.
-   Missing or incomplete documents can add 5-10 business days to the timeline.
-   Emergency applications are not an option.
-   You can track your application's progress through your provider's platform.

Ensure your records are up-to-date to address any follow-up questions promptly.

## Review and Approval

The ICP filing review process includes several layers of evaluation by Chinese authorities.

### Review Steps

-   **Technical Review**  
    Authorities examine server setup, network security, data storage practices, and the overall technical architecture.
    
-   **Content Review**  
    This involves moderating user-generated content, managing content distribution, and ensuring privacy and data handling policies align with regulations.
    
-   **Legal Compliance Review**  
    Officials verify business registration, legal representative credentials, any required industry-specific licenses, and adherence to cross-border data rules.
    

### Common Rejection Reasons

| Rejection Reason | Description | Suggested Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Incomplete Documentation | Missing or outdated business certificates | Submit a full set of updated and valid documents |
| Server Location Issues | Servers not hosted in mainland China | Switch to a hosting provider with servers in mainland China |
| Content Violations | Prohibited or restricted content found | Adjust your content to meet regulatory standards |
| Technical Non-compliance | Security measures are inadequate | Improve security protocols and configurations |
| Incorrect Information | Errors in company or representative details | Double-check and correct all submitted information |

Addressing these issues promptly is essential before proceeding with the ICP filing process.

### Using Your ICP Number

Once approved, correctly implementing and maintaining your ICP number is essential.

-   **Display**  
    Include the complete ICP license (e.g., 京ICP备XXXXXXXX号) in a visible location within your app, such as the 'About' or settings section. Use both Chinese and English, and link it to the official verification site, if possible.
    
-   **Maintenance**  
    Update your ICP details immediately if there are any changes to your business or contact information to stay compliant.
    

Properly displaying and regularly updating your ICP number ensures you remain aligned with Chinese regulations.

## Post-Approval Management

Once your ICP filing is approved, staying compliant requires consistent attention and management. Here's how you can keep everything on track.

### Keeping Information Up to Date

It's important to update your ICP filing details whenever changes occur. Notify your filing provider immediately about updates in the following areas:

-   **Company Details**: Changes in legal representative, licenses, address, or contact information.
-   **App Details**: Adjustments to functionality, servers, domains, or content.
-   **Technical Details**: Updates to hosting, security measures, or data storage locations.

Processing these updates typically takes 3-7 business days.

### Monitoring Compliance

Regular checks are key to ensuring you meet Chinese regulatory standards. Here are some essential areas to monitor:

| Monitoring Area | Frequency | Key Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Content Audit | Monthly | Review user content and remove violations. |
| Security Check | Quarterly | Check encryption and update certificates. |
| Server Performance | Weekly | Track uptime and response times. |
| User Data Review | Monthly | Ensure data storage complies with privacy rules. |
| Documentation | Quarterly | Update licenses and certificates. |

### Key Compliance Practices

To stay compliant, focus on these critical tasks:

-   Keep detailed records of all content changes.
-   Document server maintenance and security updates thoroughly.
-   Maintain logs of how user data is handled.
-   Back up all compliance-related documents.
-   Schedule regular internal audits to review compliance.

### Emergency Response Protocol

Be prepared for compliance issues by establishing a response plan:

1.  Assign a compliance officer to oversee issues.
2.  Set up clear communication channels with relevant authorities.
3.  Consult with local legal experts as needed.
4.  Keep detailed records of any compliance incidents.
5.  Develop procedures to address and resolve violations efficiently.
