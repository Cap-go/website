## Before You Start

Get your environment ready by following these steps:

### Set Up [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and npm

![Node.js](https://assets.seobotai.com/capgo.app/67ef362eebbb9dc80641f34f/a74739743b1f15b8d0bf124a9c30cba9.jpg)

You'll need Node.js version 16 or higher. The latest LTS version is recommended. To check your setup, run:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

If you need to update, download Node.js (which includes npm) from the official website.

After confirming Node.js is ready, ensure your web project meets the necessary Capacitor requirements.

### Check Your Web Project

Your web project should have the following:

-   **A valid package.json**: Make sure it's properly configured.
-   **A build directory**: This is where your web assets live (commonly `dist` or `www`).
-   **An entry point**: Your build directory must include an `index.html` file.

Here’s a quick look at key `package.json` fields:

| Required Field | Example Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | "my-app" | Identifies the project |
| version | "1.0.0" | Specifies app version |
| build directory | "dist" or "www" | Points to web assets |

Once your Node.js and web project are ready, move on to installing platform-specific tools.

### Install Required Software

**For Android Development:**

-   Download and install the latest version of **[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)**.
-   Set up the Android SDK with at least API level 22.
-   Configure the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable.

**For iOS Development (Mac only):**

-   Install **[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) 14** or a newer version.
    
-   Install Command Line Tools.
    
-   Use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/):
    
    ```bash
    brew install cocoapods
    ```
    
-   Accept the Xcode license:
    
    ```bash
    sudo xcodebuild -license accept
    ```
    

When integrating Capgo later, make sure you have a stable internet connection and valid SSL certificates.

With these steps done, you're set for a smooth Capacitor development process. Next, you’ll install the Capacitor CLI.

## Install Capacitor CLI

With your environment ready, it's time to install and configure Capacitor CLI.

### Add Capacitor Packages

Start by installing the Capacitor CLI and Core packages using npm:

```bash
npm install @capacitor/cli @capacitor/core
```

Once installed, confirm the setup by checking the [Capacitor version](https://capgo.app/plugins/ivs-player/):

```bash
npx cap --version
```

### Set Up Your Project

Initialize Capacitor in your project with the following command:

```bash
npx cap init
```

During initialization, you'll be prompted to provide these details:

| Setting | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App Name | The name displayed in app stores | "My Awesome App" |
| App ID | A unique identifier for your app | "com.mycompany.myapp" |
| Web Directory | Path to your web assets | "dist" or "www" |

Next, update your configuration file (`capacitor.config.ts` or `capacitor.config.json`) with the relevant settings:

```typescript
import { CapacitorConfig } from '@capacitor/cli';

const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  appId: 'com.mycompany.myapp',
  appName: 'My Awesome App',
  webDir: 'dist',
  bundledWebRuntime: false
};

export default config;
```

### Set Up iOS and Android

Add support for iOS and Android platforms with these commands:

```bash
npx cap add ios
npx cap add android
```

This will generate native projects:

-   **iOS**: Creates an `ios` folder containing the Xcode project.
-   **Android**: Creates an `android` folder for the Android Studio project.

After making any changes to your web assets, run the following commands to build and sync:

```bash
npm run build
npx cap sync
```

This process compiles your web assets and transfers them to the native projects, including any installed [Capacitor plugins](https://capgo.app/plugins/).

To open the native projects for further customization:

```bash
npx cap open ios     # Opens Xcode
npx cap open android # Opens Android Studio
```

Now you're ready to test your setup and resolve any issues that may arise.

## Fix Common Problems

When setting up Capacitor CLI, you might run into a few common hiccups. Here's how to tackle them:

### Android Gradle Issues

If you're facing Gradle-related problems, try these steps:

1.  Navigate to the Android directory and clear the build cache:
    
    ```bash
    cd android
    ./gradlew cleanBuildCache
    ```
    
2.  Update the Gradle version in `android/build.gradle`:
    
    ```gradle
    buildscript {
        ext {
            gradleVersion = '8.1.0'
        }
    }
    ```
    
3.  Add the following lines to `android/gradle.properties` for better performance:
    
    ```properties
    org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx4608m
    org.gradle.parallel=true
    ```
    

If problems persist, revisit your setup or consult additional troubleshooting resources.

### App Shows Blank Screen

A blank screen usually points to a configuration issue. Here's how to address it:

-   **Check the Web Directory Path**: Ensure the `webDir` matches your build output.
    
    ```typescript
    const config: CapacitorConfig = {
        webDir: 'dist', // Adjust if necessary
    };
    ```
    
-   **Verify Server Configuration**: Confirm the server settings are correct.
    
    ```typescript
    server: {
        url: 'http://localhost:3000',
        cleartext: true
    }
    ```
    
-   **Update Content Security Policy**: Add this meta tag to your HTML for proper resource loading.
    
    ```html
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' data: *">
    ```
    

### Plugin Not Working

If a plugin isn't behaving as expected, follow these steps:

1.  Perform a clean installation of dependencies:
    
    ```bash
    rm -rf node_modules
    npm cache clean --force
    npm install
    ```
    
2.  Check the plugin settings in `capacitor.config.ts` to ensure they're configured correctly:
    
    ```typescript
    plugins: {
        PluginName: {
            option: 'value'
        }
    }
    ```
    

For those using [Capgo's native plugin](https://capgo.app/plugins/), it automatically synchronizes plugins and maintains compatibility during updates.

After applying these fixes, rebuild your project to verify the changes:

```bash
npm run build && npx cap copy && npx cap sync
```

Once everything is running smoothly, you can move forward with exploring live update options with Capgo.
