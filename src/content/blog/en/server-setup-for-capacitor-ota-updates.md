## Server Requirements

[Capacitor OTA updates](https://capgo.app/) rely on specific hardware and software to ensure secure and efficient delivery. Below are the key requirements for setting up a [production-ready OTA update server](https://capgo.app/it/docs/plugin/self-hosted/getting-started/).

### System Specifications

Your server should be capable of handling multiple [update requests](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/hybrid-update) simultaneously.

| Resource | Minimum Requirement | Recommended |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CPU** | 2 vCPUs | 4+ vCPUs |
| **RAM** | 4GB | 8GB+ |
| **Storage** | 50GB SSD | 100GB+ SSD |
| **Network** | 100 Mbps | 1 Gbps |

The server should run **Node.js 18+** on a Linux-based operating system, such as **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** or **Amazon Linux 2**, to support modern JavaScript features and the latest Capacitor CLI.

Once the hardware is set, you’ll need to integrate the necessary tools for a complete setup.

### Required Tools

Here’s a breakdown of the essential components:

| Component | Purpose | Version/Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Capacitor CLI** | Core development tools | v6.0+ |
| **Node.js** | Runtime environment | v18.0+ |
| **SSL Certificate** | Secure communications | Valid HTTPS certificate |
| **Domain Name** | Hosting update endpoint | Dedicated domain |
| **CI/CD Platform** | Deployment automation | Jenkins or GitHub Actions |

For production environments, use SSL certificates issued by trusted authorities to ensure secure communications. Proper DNS configuration is also critical for reliable update delivery.

To further streamline the process, consider integrating testing frameworks like **[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)** or **[Appium](http://appium.io/)** into your workflow. These tools can help validate updates before they are deployed, minimizing the risk of errors reaching your users.

Keep in mind, these specifications are a baseline for production environments. If your application handles high traffic or frequent updates, you may need to scale these resources to match your specific needs.

## Server Setup Steps

Follow these steps to configure your server components for securely and efficiently delivering Capacitor OTA updates.

### Web Server Setup

Begin by setting up a web server to serve your static files. **Nginx** is a popular option due to its strong performance and straightforward configuration. Your server should handle both static files and update distribution.

Here’s a simple Nginx configuration to serve Capacitor app updates:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    location / {
        root /var/www/html/updates;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;

        # Prevent index.html caching
        add_header Cache-Control "no-cache";
    }
}
```

For better organization, structure your update files into separate directories:

-   `/dist/spa` for builds
-   `/updates` for version bundles
-   `/meta` for metadata

Once the web server is configured, make sure to secure it with SSL.

### SSL Certificate Setup

To secure your server, install an SSL certificate using **[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)**. Start by installing Certbot, generate your certificate, and set up a Cron job for automatic renewal.

Here’s how you can configure Nginx for HTTPS:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain/privkey.pem;

    # Modern SSL configuration
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256;
}
```

With SSL in place, you’re ready to move on to configuring the OTA plugin.

### OTA Plugin Setup

To optimize update distribution, adjust compression settings. Note that **Brotli compression** should be disabled for Android compatibility:

```nginx
# Compression settings
gzip on;
gzip_types text/plain application/javascript application/json;
gzip_min_length 1000;

# Disable Brotli for Android compatibility
brotli off;
```

When serving updates, ensure that the correct content encoding headers are applied based on file type. Use the table below as a reference:

| File Type | Encoding | Header |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JavaScript | gzip | `Content-Encoding: gzip` |
| JSON | gzip | `Content-Encoding: gzip` |
| Static Assets | none | No encoding header |

These configurations ensure that updates are delivered efficiently and compatibility issues are minimized.

## Security Setup

Strong security measures are essential to safeguard your OTA update system from unauthorized access and tampering.

### Update Verification

Implement a multi-layered verification process to maintain the integrity of your updates. Start with **SHA-256 hash verification** to detect any tampering:

```bash
# Generate SHA-256 hash for the update package
sha256sum update-package.zip > checksum.txt

# Verify the package integrity
echo "$(cat checksum.txt) update-package.zip" | sha256sum --check
```

Additionally, enable digital signature validation using **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**. Store private keys securely in an encrypted vault, and distribute public keys to client devices for verification.

| Security Layer | Implementation | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hash Verification | SHA-256 | Detect file tampering |
| Digital Signatures | RSA/ECDSA | Verify the update source |
| Package Encryption | AES-256-GCM | Protect update content |

To further secure your system, enforce access restrictions to control who can distribute updates.

### Access Controls

Use strict access control measures like **IP whitelisting** and **rate limiting** to prevent unauthorized distribution:

```nginx
# IP whitelist configuration
location /updates/ {
    allow 192.168.1.0/24;  # Internal network
    allow 10.0.0.0/8;      # VPN network
    deny all;              # Block all other IPs
}

# Rate limiting
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=updates:10m rate=10r/s;
location /updates/ {
    limit_req zone=updates burst=20;
}
```

Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for managing encryption keys. Monitor key usage closely and set up automated alerts for suspicious activity.

| Alert Level | Trigger | Response Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Low | Unusual access patterns | Investigate and document findings |
| Medium | Multiple failed operations | Temporarily suspend key usage |
| High | Confirmed compromise | Rotate the key without delay |
| Critical | Active exploit detected | Replace all system keys immediately |

These measures ensure that only authorized personnel can handle sensitive operations.

### Data Protection

Protect your update packages with **AES-256-GCM encryption**, a widely trusted [encryption standard](https://capgo.app/docs/cli/migrations/encryption/) known for its resilience against modern threats. Configure your system to include audit logging for tracking all interactions:

```json
{
    "encryption": {
        "algorithm": "AES-256-GCM",
        "key_rotation": "30days",
        "audit_logging": true
    }
}
```

Regular monitoring is essential to identify and mitigate potential security breaches. Combine these practices with frequent audits to maintain a secure OTA update system.
