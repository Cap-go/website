## Platform Update Systems

Building on the earlier overview, iOS and Android utilize distinct update systems, each influencing how updates are deployed and managed.

### iOS Update Requirements

The iOS [update process](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/manual-update/) is heavily shaped by Apple's App Store review system. With a team of over 500 experts manually reviewing around 100,000 apps each week [\[2\]](https://thisisglance.com/learning-centre/how-does-the-app-store-approval-process-work), the process prioritizes quality and compliance. Although Apple claims to review 90% of app submissions within 24 hours [\[2\]](https://thisisglance.com/learning-centre/how-does-the-app-store-approval-process-work), developers must account for potential delays when planning releases.

Here are some key factors for iOS updates:

## Update Management Guidelines

Building on the challenges outlined earlier, here’s how to implement updates securely and efficiently for both iOS and Android platforms.

### iOS Update Steps

For iOS, follow these steps to manage updates effectively:

-   **Set Up Version Control**  
    Update the `CFBundleShortVersionString` in the `ios/App/App/Info.plist` file. Automation tools like `capacitor-set-version` can simplify this process [\[7\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58252699/how-do-you-update-the-ios-android-app-version-in-ionic-w-capacitor).
    
-   **Prepare the Update Bundle**  
    Package the full production output (typically found in `dist/` or `www/`) and include digital signatures to ensure security [\[16\]](https://capawesome.io/blog/how-live-updates-for-capacitor-work).
    
-   **Verify Implementation**  
    Before deployment, confirm that the update:
    
    -   Maintains core app functionality.
    -   Does not create duplicate market entries.
    -   Complies with OS security and sandboxing rules.
    -   Properly invokes `CapacitorUpdater.notifyAppReady()` once the app is loaded.

### Android Update Steps

Android updates provide more flexibility but come with specific requirements:

-   **Configure Versioning**  
    Adjust the `versionName` variable in the `android/app/build.gradle` file to track app versions accurately [\[7\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58252699/how-do-you-update-the-ios-android-app-version-in-ionic-w-capacitor).
    
-   **Optimize Deployment Strategy**  
    Efficient deployment can save both time and resources. For instance, Capgo's EcoTrack reduced deployment time from two weeks to just 15 minutes, resulting in savings of $50,000 [\[16\]](https://capawesome.io/blog/how-live-updates-for-capacitor-work).
    
-   **Address Platform-Specific Needs**  
    When managing Android updates, focus on:
    
    -   Storing the next server path using `SharedPreferences`.
    -   Configuring the Capacitor Android Bridge to align with the current server path.
    -   Handling WebView file loading instructions correctly.
    
    Google's policy on interpreted code offers some leniency for Android apps:
    
    > "This restriction does not apply to code that runs in a virtual machine or an interpreter where either provides indirect access to Android APIs (such as JavaScript in a webview or browser)" [\[16\]](https://capawesome.io/blog/how-live-updates-for-capacitor-work).
    

## Summary and Recommendations

### Platform Update Differences

iOS and Android take different approaches when it comes to versioning and update flexibility. iOS follows a three-part versioning system (e.g., 1.0.0), while Android uses a version code format (e.g., 100) [\[17\]](https://app.studyraid.com/en/read/11146/345618/handling-app-updates-and-versioning). Both platforms allow updates to web content [\[9\]](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/guides/deploying-updates), but iOS enforces stricter regulations to safeguard core functionality [\[18\]](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@capgo/capacitor-updater).
