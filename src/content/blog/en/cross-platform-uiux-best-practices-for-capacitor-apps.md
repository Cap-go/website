## Cross-Platform Design Fundamentals

Creating a seamless user experience across platforms means balancing platform-specific design patterns with your app's unique style. Here's how you can achieve it.

### Building a Design System

A design system serves as the backbone of your app's cross-platform design. It typically includes:

-   **Design tokens**: These are the values for colors, typography, spacing, and animations.
-   **Component library**: A collection of reusable UI elements designed to align with platform norms.
-   **Documentation**: Clear guidelines to ensure consistent use and implementation.

### Platform Design Guidelines

To maintain a consistent look while respecting platform-specific standards, consider the following:

| **Design Element** | **iOS (Human Interface)** | **Android (Material)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Navigation | Tab bars, bottom-aligned | Navigation drawer, top app bar |
| Typography | San Francisco font | Roboto font |
| Gestures | Edge swipe for back | Focus on bottom navigation |
| Buttons | Rounded corners, subtle effects | Contained or outlined buttons |

Next, let's tackle the complexities of designing for various screen sizes.

### Multi-Screen Layout Design

Designing for different screen sizes requires flexibility. Here are some strategies:

-   **Responsive Grid System**  
    Use a grid that adjusts dynamically to fit any screen size.
    
-   **Breakpoint Strategy**  
    Define layout adjustments based on screen width:
    
    -   _Small (< 600px)_: Single-column layout
    -   _Medium (600–1024px)_: Two-column layout
    -   _Large (> 1024px)_: Multi-column layout, often with sidebars
-   **Component Scaling**  
    Ensure components scale proportionally. For touch targets, follow these guidelines: at least 44x44 pixels on iOS and 48x48 density-independent pixels on Android.
    

With tools like Capgo's live update features, you can quickly refine and improve your design system.

## Building UI Components

Creating high-performance UI components requires careful attention to cross-platform compatibility and efficient performance. Let’s look at some practical methods for building reusable and effective components.
