## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Prepare your setup with the necessary tools to handle [Capacitor plugin](https://capgo.app/blog/capacitor-comprehensive-guide/) dependencies effectively.

### Required Development Tools

Here’s a list of tools you’ll need:

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js | 16.0.0+ | JavaScript runtime environment |
| npm | 8.0.0+ | Package management |
| Xcode | 14.0+ | iOS development (Mac only) |
| Android Studio | Electric Eel+ | Android development |
| CocoaPods | 1.11.0+ | iOS dependency management |
| JDK | 11+ | Android build tools |

### Starting a New Plugin

Use the Capacitor CLI to kick off your plugin project. This includes setting up platforms and naming your plugin using a reverse-domain format (e.g., `com.mycompany.plugin`):

1.  Run the following command:  
    `npm init @capacitor/plugin`
2.  Choose your target platforms (iOS/Android).
3.  Assign a name to your plugin in reverse-domain format.

### Project Setup Steps

1.  **Update `package.json`**
    
    Modify your `package.json` to include the following:
    
    ```json
    {
      "capacitor": {
        "ios": {
          "src": "ios"
        },
        "android": {
          "src": "android"
        }
      },
      "peerDependencies": {
        "@capacitor/core": "^5.0.0"
      }
    }
    ```
    
2.  **Platform-Specific Setup**
    
    -   For **iOS**, ensure your Podfile includes:
        
        ```ruby
        platform :ios, '13.0'
        use_frameworks!
        ```
        
    -   For **Android**, verify your `build.gradle` contains:
        
        ```gradle
        android {
            compileSdkVersion 33
            defaultConfig {
                minSdkVersion 22
            }
        }
        ```
        
3.  **Set Up Environment Variables**
    
    Configure the following environment variables for your development tools:
    
    | Variable | Purpose | Example Value |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | ANDROID\_HOME | Android SDK location | /Users/username/Library/Android/sdk |
    | JAVA\_HOME | JDK installation path | /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.12.jdk/Contents/Home |
    | XCODE\_SELECT | Xcode command line tools | /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer |
    

Once your project is set up, you're ready to move on to managing JavaScript dependencies.

## JavaScript Dependencies

Effectively managing JavaScript dependencies is key to maintaining stable plugin performance.

### [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) Package Installation

![npm](https://mars-images.imgix.net/seobot/screenshots/www.npmjs.com-ac76028e07fa565ed4006978107f5ce6-2025-03-27.jpg?auto=compress)

To install dependencies, use the following commands:

```bash
# Add a production dependency
npm install lodash --save

# Add a development dependency
npm install @types/lodash --save-dev
```

Make sure to manually include peer dependencies in your `package.json` file. Test all dependencies to confirm compatibility across both web and native platforms.

### Managing package.json

Here’s an example `package.json` configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "my-capacitor-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "^4.17.21"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/lodash": "^4.14.195",
    "@capacitor/core": "^5.0.0"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@capacitor/core": "^5.0.0"
  }
}
```

To maintain consistency, lock dependency versions appropriately:

| Constraint Type | Example | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Exact | "5.0.0" | For critical dependencies requiring a specific version |
| Caret | "^5.0.0" | Allows minor updates and patches |
| Tilde | "~5.0.0" | Restricts updates to patches only |

### Using JavaScript Libraries

When importing libraries, focus on reducing the bundle size:

```typescript
// Import only the required function
import { isEqual } from 'lodash';

export class MyPlugin {
  async compare(options: { value1: any, value2: any }): Promise<boolean> {
    return isEqual(options.value1, options.value2);
  }
}
```

Additionally, ensure proper error handling and type checking:

```typescript
import { Plugin } from '@capacitor/core';
import { validate } from 'your-validation-library';

@Plugin({
  name: 'MyPlugin',
  platforms: ['web', 'ios', 'android']
})
export class MyPlugin {
  async validateData(data: unknown): Promise<void> {
    try {
      if (!validate(data)) {
        throw new Error('Invalid data format');
      }
      // Continue processing if valid
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error(`Validation failed: ${error.message}`);
    }
  }
}
```

Up next, explore how to handle platform-specific dependencies for iOS.

## iOS Dependencies

This section explains how to manage native iOS dependencies in [Capacitor plugins](https://capgo.app/plugins/). Once you've set up your JavaScript dependencies, the next step is handling native iOS dependencies.

### [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) Setup

![CocoaPods](https://mars-images.imgix.net/seobot/screenshots/cocoapods.org-fd202c6f9998fdf4cafb9b363e43119c-2025-03-27.jpg?auto=compress)

Start by initializing CocoaPods in your iOS directory:

```bash
cd ios
pod init
```

Then, update your `Plugin.podspec` file with the following configurations:

```ruby
Pod::Spec.new do |s|
  s.name = 'MyCapacitorPlugin'
  s.version = '1.0.0'
  s.summary = 'Your plugin description'
  s.platform = :ios, '13.0'
  s.dependency 'Capacitor'
  # Include your iOS dependencies here
  s.dependency 'Alamofire', '~> 5.6.4'
end
```

### Podfile Configuration

After initializing CocoaPods, configure the Podfile to include Capacitor and any additional third-party libraries:

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
use_frameworks!

def capacitor_pods
  pod 'Capacitor', :path => '../../node_modules/@capacitor/ios'
  pod 'CapacitorCordova', :path => '../../node_modules/@capacitor/ios'
end

target 'Plugin' do
  capacitor_pods
  # Add third-party dependencies
  pod 'KeychainAccess', '~> 4.2.2'
  pod 'SwiftyJSON', '~> 5.0.1'
end

target 'PluginTests' do
  capacitor_pods
end
```

Here are some common dependency configuration patterns:

| Constraint Type | Example | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Exact Version | `pod 'KeychainAccess', '4.2.2'` | When precise control is needed, such as for security components |
| Minor Version | `pod 'Alamofire', '~> 5.6'` | For stable APIs that may receive patch updates |
| Major Version | `pod 'SwiftyJSON', '> 5.0'` | When flexibility across updates is acceptable |

### Swift Package Dependencies

If you'd rather not use CocoaPods, Swift Package Manager (SPM) is a good alternative. Add SPM dependencies directly in Xcode with the following configuration in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
// Package.swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "5.6.4")),
    .package(url: "https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON.git", from: "5.0.1")
]
```

To use SPM dependencies in your plugin code, import them and integrate as needed. For example:

```swift
import Capacitor
import Alamofire

@objc(MyPlugin)
public class MyPlugin: CAPPlugin {
    @objc func makeRequest(_ call: CAPPluginCall) {
        AF.request("https://api.example.com/data").response { response in
            // Process the response
            call.resolve([
                "data": response.data
            ])
        }
    }
}
```

This approach allows you to choose between CocoaPods and Swift Package Manager based on your project requirements.

## Android Dependencies

Set up Android dependencies to ensure smooth native integration. Here's how to manage dependencies for your Capacitor plugin.

### [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) Dependencies

![Gradle](https://mars-images.imgix.net/seobot/screenshots/gradle.org-85d271057dfb5e2e134ec99beaad5682-2025-03-27.jpg?auto=compress)

Add the following configurations to your `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 22
        targetSdkVersion 33
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation "androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.6.1"
    implementation "com.google.code.gson:gson:2.10.1"
    implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:1.8.20"
    implementation project(':capacitor-android')
}
```

Define additional versions in the `buildscript` block:

```gradle
buildscript {
    ext {
        androidxCoreVersion = '1.10.1'
        kotlinVersion = '1.8.20'
    }
}
```

Once dependencies are configured, make sure to set up the necessary repositories.

### Repository Configuration

In your project-level `build.gradle`, include the required Maven repositories:

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

If you're using custom or private Maven repositories, add credentials like this:

```gradle
maven {
    url "https://maven.example.com/releases"
    credentials {
        username = project.findProperty("mavenUsername") ?: System.getenv("MAVEN_USERNAME")
        password = project.findProperty("mavenPassword") ?: System.getenv("MAVEN_PASSWORD")
    }
}
```

With repositories set up, address any dependency conflicts that may arise.

### Fixing Compatibility Issues

To handle dependency conflicts, apply version resolutions in your `build.gradle`:

```gradle
configurations.all {
    resolutionStrategy {
        force "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:1.8.20"
        force "androidx.core:core-ktx:1.10.1"
    }
}
```

Here are strategies for resolving common dependency issues:

| Issue Type | Strategy | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Version Conflict | Force a specific version | `force 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.10.1'` |
| Multiple Versions | Exclude a module | `exclude group: 'org.json', module: 'json'` |
| Transitive Issues | Use strict versions | `strictly 'androidx.core:core-ktx:1.10.1'` |

For instance, you can exclude conflicting modules like this:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation('library:name:1.0.0') {
        exclude group: 'com.conflicting.dependency'
    }
}
```

Finally, optimize your build process by enabling caching and parallel execution in `gradle.properties`:

```properties
org.gradle.caching=true
org.gradle.parallel=true
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2048m
```
