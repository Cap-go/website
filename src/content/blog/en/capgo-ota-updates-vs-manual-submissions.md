## [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) OTA vs Manual Updates: Core Differences

![Capgo](https://assets.seobotai.com/capgo.app/682c8ab34fa53d42207d8d4e/974242599310258c114f19dd9b6b5656.jpg)

Capgo OTA updates stand apart from manual app store submissions in terms of deployment speed, resource efficiency, and overall workflow. These differences significantly impact both developer productivity and user experience.

### Feature Comparison

Here’s how Capgo OTA updates stack up against traditional app store submissions:

| Feature | Capgo OTA Updates | Manual App Store Updates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deployment Time | Minutes to hours | 2–7 days |
| Update Success Rate | 95% within 24 hours | Variable (user-dependent) |

| Bandwidth Usage | Only changed content | Full app download |
| Rollback Capability | Instant one-click | New submission required |
| Cost Structure | From $12/month | $99/year (Apple), $25 (Google) |

### Update Speed Analysis

The difference in update speed is one of the most striking advantages of Capgo OTA. Developers using Capgo can roll out updates in mere minutes, while traditional app store submissions often take days. This delay stems from stringent app store review processes and guidelines.

Apple’s App Store Guidelines state:

> "Interpreted code may be downloaded to an Application, but only so long as such code: (a) does not change the primary purpose of the Application by providing features or functionality that are inconsistent with the intended and advertised purpose of the Application as submitted to the App Store (b) does not create a store or storefront for other code or applications (c) does not bypass signing, sandbox, or other security features of the OS." – Apple App Store Guidelines [\[2\]](https://capgo.app/docs/faq)

Capgo adheres to these policies by using a custom Dart interpreter. This ensures updates are compliant while still allowing for rapid deployment, bridging the gap between speed and regulation.

### Code Update Limits

Capgo’s OTA updates focus exclusively on web assets and JavaScript code, whereas changes to native code still require manual app store submissions. Here’s a breakdown:

-   **What Can Be Updated**: JavaScript code and web assets are eligible for OTA updates, enabling quick fixes and feature rollouts.
-   **What Requires Manual Submission**: Native code changes - such as those involving Java/Kotlin for Android or Objective-C/Swift for iOS - must go through the traditional app store process.
-   **Update Size**: Capgo minimizes bandwidth use by transmitting only the modified content, unlike app store updates that require users to download the entire app again.

## [App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/) Rules and Requirements

![App Store](https://assets.seobotai.com/capgo.app/682c8ab34fa53d42207d8d4e/ab359297e839832a0f76203cfe630f58.jpg)

App store guidelines play a critical role in shaping [update strategies](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/hybrid-update). Both Apple and Google have specific rules that dictate how developers can implement OTA (Over-The-Air) updates versus traditional app submissions. Here’s how Capgo ensures its updates align with these regulatory standards.

### Apple Store Guidelines

Capgo's custom Dart interpreter adheres to Apple's strict policies for handling interpreted code. Apple’s guidelines state:

> "Interpreted code may be downloaded to an Application, but only so long as such code: (a) does not change the primary purpose of the Application, (b) does not create a store or storefront for other code or applications, and (c) does not bypass signing, sandbox, or other security features of the OS." [\[2\]](https://capgo.app/docs/faq)

Capgo ensures compliance by focusing on the following:

| **Requirement** | **How It’s Met** |
| --- | --- |
| Purpose Consistency | Updates maintain the app's original functionality. |
| Code Interpretation | Uses a custom Dart interpreter to handle updates. |
| Security Features | Fully preserves iOS sandbox and security measures. |
| Update Scope | Limits updates to JavaScript and web assets. |

### [Google Play](https://play.google.com/console/signup) Requirements

![Google Play](https://assets.seobotai.com/capgo.app/682c8ab34fa53d42207d8d4e/6fab1123dba2d1a9b508fae064f81971.jpg)

Google’s guidelines are more flexible than Apple’s but still emphasize security and app integrity. Google Play mandates that updates must maintain the app’s core purpose and meet strict security standards.

Key compliance measures include:

| **Requirement** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| Update Method | Must use an interpreter or virtual machine. |
| Content Changes | Updates cannot alter the app's primary purpose. |
| Security | All updates must meet Play Store security standards. |
| User Experience | Updates must be transparent to users. |

To ensure compliance with both platforms, developers should:

-   Keep detailed documentation for every update.
-   Use proper versioning to track changes.
-   Conduct thorough testing before releasing updates.
-   Monitor the scope of updates to avoid exceeding guidelines.

Failure to follow these rules can lead to app removal or even account termination. To prevent misuse, Capgo’s [Terms of Service](https://capgo.app/tos/) strictly prohibit using the platform to bypass app store policies, ensuring updates remain secure and compliant.

## Impact on Development Process

Capgo's over-the-air (OTA) updates simplify workflows, offering a faster alternative to the lengthy review processes required by manual submissions.

### Why Capgo's Workflow Stands Out

Capgo leverages [automated CI/CD pipelines](https://capgo.app/blog/automatic-build-and-release-with-gitlab/) and real-time monitoring to keep the development process flowing smoothly, eliminating the need for manual interventions. Here’s what makes it effective:

-   **Instant bug fixes**: Resolve issues immediately without waiting for app store approval.
-   **A/B testing made easy**: Test new features by targeting specific user groups.
-   **Live performance insights**: Monitor app performance and gather analytics in real time.
-   **Quick rollbacks**: Revert to previous versions effortlessly if needed.

This streamlined method is a game-changer compared to the rigid, step-by-step nature of manual updates, enabling teams to deliver updates faster and more efficiently.

### The Challenges of Manual Updates

When it comes to manual submissions, developers face a time-consuming process dictated by guidelines from Apple and Google. These steps often include:

-   Preparing builds within development environments.
-   Updating app store listings with [privacy information](https://capgo.app/privacy/), screenshots, and descriptions.
-   Managing delays caused by multi-platform review processes, which complicate build management.

## End-User Update Experience

When it comes to app updates, the way users experience them can vary significantly. With Capgo's OTA (Over-The-Air) updates, everything happens in the background, requiring no effort from the user. In contrast, manual updates through app stores demand user involvement.

### Auto vs Manual Updates

Here's a quick side-by-side look at how these two [update methods](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/hybrid-update/) differ:

| Update Aspect | App Store Updates | Capgo OTA Updates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Installation Process | Requires manual download from the store | Automatically handled in the background |
| Download Size | Entire app package | Only the modified content |
| Update Time | 2–7 days (due to review and download) | Minutes to hours for deployment |
| User Action Required | Yes – store visit and manual approval | No – updates apply automatically |
| Network Impact | High bandwidth usage | Minimal data consumption |

Capgo's automatic OTA updates ensure users receive fixes and new features promptly without lifting a finger. This streamlined approach not only saves time but also keeps everyone on the same page, as explained below.

### App Version Management

Capgo's OTA system simplifies version control by keeping the user base unified under the same app version. This approach brings several key benefits:

-   **Reduced Support Issues**: With everyone running the latest version, developers spend less time troubleshooting outdated software.
-   **Consistent Features and Security**: Users enjoy the latest features and security patches without delay.
-   **Controlled Rollouts**: Developers can release updates gradually to specific groups, testing changes before a full rollout.

Capgo enables developers to address critical issues quickly while maintaining a balance between frequent updates and user convenience. This approach not only improves app stability but also lays the foundation for stronger security measures.

## Security Features and Costs

When deciding between Capgo's OTA updates and traditional manual app submissions, **security** and **cost** play a major role in the decision-making process.

### Security Comparison

Manual app submissions rely heavily on the app store's built-in security measures, such as app reviews and malware scanning [\[3\]](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines). Capgo, on the other hand, takes it a step further by integrating additional safeguards through its OTA update system:

| **Security Feature** | **Capgo OTA** | **Manual Submission** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **End-to-End Encryption** | Yes | Varies by store |
| **Update Success Rate** | 82% worldwide | Store-dependent |
| **Rollback Capability** | Instant | Manual process |

While Capgo enhances security with features like end-to-end encryption and instant rollback, developers still need to prioritize secure coding practices and thorough testing to ensure app integrity [\[4\]](https://strobes.co/blog/owasp-mobile-top-10-vulnerabilities-2024-updated).

### Price Breakdown

Cost is another critical factor when choosing an update strategy. The pricing structures for OTA updates and manual submissions differ significantly:

| **Cost Factor** | **Capgo OTA** | **Manual Submission** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Setup Cost** | $2,600 (one-time CI/CD setup) | Developer account fees |
| **Monthly Fee** | From $12 (SOLO) to $249 (PAYG) | None |
| **Bandwidth** | 50GB–10TB (based on plan) | Store-managed |
| **Storage** | 2GB–20GB (based on plan) | Store-managed |
| **User Limit** | 1,000–1,000,000 MAU | Unlimited |

Though Capgo's initial CI/CD setup fee of $2,600 may seem steep, it becomes a cost-efficient solution for teams that release frequent updates or manage multiple apps [\[1\]](https://capgo.app). The monthly plans also provide flexibility based on bandwidth, storage, and user needs.

These factors highlight the trade-offs between the two approaches, helping teams choose the best fit for their app deployment strategy.
