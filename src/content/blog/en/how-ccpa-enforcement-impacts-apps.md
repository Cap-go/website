**The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)** is reshaping how mobile apps handle user data. Here's what you need to know:

-   **Who It Affects**: Apps with over $25M in annual revenue, 100,000+ users' data, or earning 50%+ revenue from selling data.
-   **Key Requirements**:
    -   Disclose data collection practices (like device IDs and IP addresses).
    -   Provide tools for users to access, delete, or opt out of data sharing.
    -   Secure data with encryption and access controls.
-   **Enforcement**: Violations can lead to fines up to $7,988 per incident. Notable cases include [Sephora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sephora) ($1.2M fine) and [DoorDash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoorDash) ($375K fine).
-   **Common Mistakes**: Missing "Do Not Sell" links, ignoring Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals, and unregulated data sharing.

**Quick Tip**: Start with a data audit, update your [privacy policy](https://capgo.app/dp/), and use tools like [OneTrust](https://www.onetrust.com/solutions/privacy-automation/) or [Osano](https://www.osano.com/) to simplify compliance. Staying compliant isn’t just about avoiding fines - it builds user trust and protects your business.

## CCPA Core Requirements for Apps

### Data Collection Disclosure

App developers must provide clear and upfront notices about the data they collect, such as device identifiers, IP addresses, and household information [\[1\]](https://www.flurry.com/ccpa-compliance-guide/). These notices should explain how the data will be used and be easily accessible - ideally within the app's settings - before any data is collected. Include all data categories and their purposes in this notice [\[3\]](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa). If your app sells or shares user data, you are required to display a prominent "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" link [\[3\]](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa).

The CCPA also emphasizes the importance of safeguarding user rights alongside these disclosures.

### User Privacy Rights

The CCPA grants app users specific rights that developers are obligated to honor within designated timeframes. Businesses must provide at least two ways for users to submit requests, such as a toll-free phone number. For apps, an interactive web form should also be available [\[4\]](https://trustarc.com/resource/handle-consumer-requests-under-ccpa/).

Here’s how to handle user requests:

-   **Access Requests**: Confirm receipt within 10 days and provide the requested data within 45 days.
-   **Deletion Requests**: Use a two-step confirmation process to verify the request.
-   **Opt-Out Requests**: Complete the opt-out process within 15 days and inform third parties who received the user’s data in the past 90 days.

> "A major factor for those seeking to comply is implementing a process for managing consumer requests under CCPA – similar to data subject access requests under GDPR." - TrustArc [\[4\]](https://trustarc.com/resource/handle-consumer-requests-under-ccpa/)

Protecting user data is a critical element of these privacy rights.

### Data Security Requirements

To support these privacy measures, the CCPA enforces strict data security standards. Key practices include:

-   **Encryption**: Apply strong encryption for both stored and transmitted data.
-   **Access Controls**: Implement strict authentication and authorization protocols.
-   **Regular Testing**: Perform routine security assessments and penetration tests.
-   **Incident Response**: Keep breach notification procedures updated and ready.

Additionally, businesses must retain records of privacy-related activities and user requests for 24 months [\[5\]](https://www.ketch.com/blog/posts/understanding-the-ccpa-right-to-deletion).

## CCPA Enforcement Examples

Recent cases highlight California's active approach to enforcing privacy laws for mobile apps, with hefty fines serving as a clear warning to developers about meeting compliance standards.

### Major Fines and Penalties

California's Attorney General and the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) have been aggressive in addressing violations of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Here are two notable cases:

**Sephora's $1.2 Million Settlement (2022)**  
Sephora agreed to pay $1.2 million after being cited for multiple compliance failures:

-   Not disclosing the sale of consumer data
-   Failing to honor Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals
-   Ignoring opt-out requests
-   Missing the 30-day window to address violations [\[2\]](https://usercentrics.com/knowledge-hub/ccpa-penalties/)

> "Technologies like the Global Privacy Control are a game changer for consumers looking to exercise their data privacy rights. But these rights are meaningless if businesses hide how they are using their customer's data and ignore requests to opt-out of its sale. I hope today's settlement sends a strong message to businesses that are still failing to comply with California's consumer privacy law. My office is watching, and we will hold you accountable." – AG Rob Bonta [\[6\]](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=4a9d5837-8557-45cf-9c49-f8030c03e9ff)

**DoorDash's $375,000 Fine (2024)**  
DoorDash was fined $375,000 for sharing customer data with a marketing cooperative without obtaining explicit consent [\[2\]](https://usercentrics.com/knowledge-hub/ccpa-penalties/).

These cases underline recurring compliance issues and highlight the challenges businesses face in adhering to privacy laws.

### Top Compliance Mistakes

Mobile apps often struggle with specific CCPA requirements, leading to common violations. Here's a breakdown of frequent mistakes and how to avoid them:

| Violation Type | Impact | Prevention Steps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Missing "Do Not Sell" Notice | Fines of up to $7,500 per consumer | Add clear opt-out links in app settings |
| Poor Consent Management | Fines up to $22,500 per minor | Use explicit consent tools, especially for users under 16 |
| Unregulated Data Sharing | Higher liability risks | Audit and document all third-party partnerships |
| Ignoring GPC Signals | Common trigger for enforcement | Ensure app recognizes and responds to GPC signals |

Two shifts in enforcement are worth noting:

-   The 30-day cure period for violations has been removed.
-   There is heightened scrutiny on compliance with Global Privacy Control requirements [\[6\]](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=4a9d5837-8557-45cf-9c49-f8030c03e9ff).

> "The Attorney General's focus is on compliance with the law, giving consumers choices and control. But the intent is not to run up revenue in California's privacy fund. It's to encourage compliance." – Melissa G. Powers, Associate at LewisRice [\[6\]](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=4a9d5837-8557-45cf-9c49-f8030c03e9ff)

These enforcement actions make it clear: mobile app developers must prioritize compliance to navigate the evolving privacy landscape while maintaining their marketing goals.

## CCPA Compliance Guide

Staying on top of compliance is crucial for mobile apps, especially in light of recent enforcement actions. Here's a practical guide to help you navigate the key steps.

### Data Audit Steps

Start by creating a detailed inventory of all user data your app collects, processes, and shares. Here's how to approach it:

-   **Identify Data Collection Points**: Document every source of data entry, such as registration forms, purchases, analytics tools, and third-party SDKs.
-   **Categorize the Data**: Break it down into types like:
    -   Identifiers (e.g., name, email, device ID)
    -   Commercial data
    -   Online activity
    -   Geolocation
    -   Biometric details
    -   Professional information

### Privacy Policy Updates

Your privacy policy must clearly explain your data practices to comply with CCPA. Use the table below as a guide:

| Section | What to Include | Tips for Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data Collection | List all types of personal information | Use simple, clear language |
| User Rights | Explain how users can access, delete, or opt out of data sharing | Provide step-by-step instructions |
| Data Sharing | Outline relationships with third parties and any data sales | Be specific about who receives the data |
| Contact Methods | Offer multiple ways to reach you | Include email, phone, and a web form |

These updates are essential for handling user rights requests effectively.

### User Rights Management

To comply with CCPA, you need systems that handle privacy requests within 45 days. Here's what to focus on:

-   **Access Requests**:
    
    -   Add a privacy dashboard within your app.
    -   Pre-fill forms with user identifiers for convenience.
    -   Use device ID tracking for users who aren't registered.
-   **Deletion Requests**:
    
    -   Automate workflows to process data deletion.
    -   Ensure third-party SDKs support data removal.
    -   Keep detailed records of all deletion requests.

### Data Security Setup

Protecting user data is a critical part of compliance. Here's how to strengthen your security:

-   **Technical Measures**:
    
    -   Use end-to-end encryption for data in transit.
    -   Encrypt stored data to keep it safe.
    -   Set up strict access controls and authentication.
    -   Conduct regular security audits.
-   **Third-Party Oversight**:
    
    -   Check that all SDKs you use comply with CCPA.
    -   Document how data is shared and provide opt-out options.
    -   Periodically review the security practices of all third parties.

For example, the [Flurry](https://www.flurry.com/) SDK includes an opt-out API that respects user preferences and manages data deletion requests [\[1\]](https://www.flurry.com/ccpa-compliance-guide/).
