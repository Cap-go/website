## Reading Update Performance Data

Understanding how updates perform in real-world scenarios is key to refining your app's delivery strategy. By closely monitoring metrics and using reliable tools, you can gain actionable insights into update performance.

### Measuring Update Usage

Tracking how users adopt updates helps you understand the speed and effectiveness of your rollout. Here are some essential metrics to monitor:

-   **Adoption Rate**: Calculate it as _(New Users of Update / Total Users) × 100_. This shows how many users are switching to the updated version.
-   **Time to First Action**: Measure how long it takes for users to engage with new features after updating.
-   **Update Success Rate**: Use _(Successful Updates / Total Update Attempts) × 100_ to gauge how smoothly the [update process](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/manual-update/) is running.

Once you have these metrics, dive deeper into how updates influence user behavior.

### User Behavior Analysis

Analyzing user behavior post-update provides a clearer picture of how updates impact engagement. For instance, setting measurable goals - like increasing user activation by 47% by the end of the quarter - can help track progress effectively [\[3\]](https://userpilot.com/blog/user-behavioral-analysis/).

Key metrics to consider:

-   **Daily Active Users (DAU)**: Observe changes in daily usage after the update.
-   **Average Session Duration**: Compare the time users spend in the app before and after the update.
-   **Feature Usage**: Identify which new features are driving the most engagement.

> "User behavior analysis is essential for product teams that don't want to rely on hunches or luck when making product decisions." - Sophie Grigoryan [\[3\]](https://userpilot.com/blog/user-behavioral-analysis/)

The next step is to test different update versions systematically.

### Testing Update Versions

Capgo's platform, with over 947.6 million updates delivered globally [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/), offers insights into effective testing strategies. Here’s what to focus on:

-   **Real-time Performance Monitoring**: Keep an eye on response times and error rates immediately after deploying updates.
-   **Resource Utilization**: Ensure the update doesn't overburden system resources or reduce app performance.
-   **Version Comparison**: Use A/B testing to evaluate different update versions with smaller user groups before rolling out widely.

These methods help ensure your updates are efficient and well-received.

## Fixing Update Problems

Addressing update issues is crucial for keeping users happy and ensuring your app runs smoothly.

### Finding Update Errors

Capacitor-updater provides tools to help you identify and resolve update errors:

-   Set up **updateFailed** and **downloadFailed** listeners to catch issues during the update process.
-   Use **notifyAppReady()** to confirm that the update bundle has successfully loaded.
-   Configure **appReadyTimeout** to detect delays in the loading process.

Tracking errors allows you to pinpoint where problems occur and take action to improve performance.

> "Appflow Live Updates lets you deploy web code changes directly to users' installed apps without requiring them to download a new version from the app stores. Think of it as a silent upgrade in the background that can fix bugs, introduce new features, and optimize performance." – Ashwini Shukla, Product Manager for Appflow [\[5\]](https://ionic.io/blog/capacitor-live-updates-sdk-is-now-ga)

### Fixing Speed Issues

Monitoring performance is essential to ensure updates are delivered quickly and efficiently. Beta tests show that updates are often completed in just seconds [\[4\]](https://ionic.io/blog/the-future-of-live-updates-is-here-and-its-more-performant-than-ever).

Key metrics to track include:

-   Load times and response rates
-   Memory usage
-   CPU usage
-   Network requests
-   Crash frequency

Tools like **Firebase Performance Monitoring** or **[Sentry](https://sentry.io/)** can help you monitor these metrics and set up alerts for potential problems.

### Update Size Management

Keeping update sizes small is critical for faster delivery. Here are some effective techniques:

| Technique | Effect | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Production Flags | Reduces bundle size | Use `--prod` and `--release` flags |
| Code Minification | Decreases APK size | Enable `minifyEnabled` |
| Resource Cleanup | Removes unused files | Delete unused SVGs and stale chunks |
| Source Map Management | Reduces file size | Disable `sourceMap` in `angular.json` |

For instance, removing unused SVGs reduced one app's APK size from 4.2 MB to 3.4 MB [\[6\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50988174/how-do-i-decrease-the-size-of-the-ionic-android-apk-file).

Capgo's platform offers automated tools to optimize update sizes. Their differential update system transfers only the files that have changed, speeding up delivery and improving overall performance while ensuring compliance with app store requirements.

## Update Tracking Guidelines

### Setting Standard Metrics

To track update performance effectively, use consistent metrics that directly affect user experience. Key areas to monitor include:

| Metric Category | Key Measurement |
| --- | --- |
| **Load Time** | Aim for the app to load in under 3 seconds |
| **Crash Reports** | Keep app crashes to a minimum |
| **Memory Usage** | Ensure efficient memory use, especially on low-end devices |
| **CPU Usage** | Monitor CPU activity during updates |
| **Network Requests** | Track the success rate of network requests during updates |

Research by [UXCam](https://uxcam.com/) shows that 53% of users abandon apps that take longer than 3 seconds to load [\[7\]](https://uxcam.com/blog/how-to-improve-mobile-app-performance/). Keeping a close eye on these metrics for both iOS and Android platforms ensures consistent performance across devices.

Once you've identified your metrics, organize them into clear, concise reports for quick analysis.
