**Keeping secrets secure in CI/CD pipelines is critical to prevent breaches, service disruptions, and compliance issues.** Here's how to do it effectively:

-   **Use environment variables** and **secure vaults** to store secrets securely.
-   **Limit access** by granting only necessary privileges and rotating secrets regularly.
-   **Automate secret scanning** with tools like `git-secrets` or `truffleHog` to catch leaks early.
-   **Leverage CI/CD tools** like [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions), [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), or [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) for built-in secret management.
-   **Monitor and audit** secret usage with detailed logs.

### Common CI/CD Secrets

-   [API keys](https://capgo.app/docs/webapp/api-keys/)
-   Database credentials
-   Encryption keys
-   Authentication tokens
-   SSL certificates

### Popular Secret Management Platforms

| Platform | Features | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[HashiCorp Vault](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault)** | Dynamic secrets, encryption, access control | Large-scale operations |
| **[AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/)** | AWS integration, auto-rotation | AWS-centric setups |
| **[Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/)** | Certificate handling, key rotation | Microsoft environments |

By following these practices and using the right tools, you can safeguard your CI/CD pipelines and maintain secure workflows.

## Security Guidelines for Secrets

### Keep Secrets Out of Your Code

-   Use **environment variables** to manage sensitive information.
-   Store secrets in a **secure vault** designed for this purpose.
-   Connect your CI/CD pipeline to the vault to inject credentials during the build process.

### Limit and Monitor Access

Grant only the **minimum necessary privileges** to each user or service, and review permissions frequently.

Additionally, rotate secrets on a regular schedule and maintain an **audit log** to track and identify any potential breaches.

## Secret Management Tools

Once security guidelines are in place, it's time to deploy tools designed specifically for managing secrets.

### Secret Storage Platforms

Centralize and monitor all your secrets using these tools:

| Platform | Features | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **HashiCorp Vault** | Dynamic secrets, encryption services, identity-based access | Large-scale operations |
| **AWS Secrets Manager** | Seamless AWS integration, automatic rotation, fine-grained permissions | AWS-focused setups |
| **Azure Key Vault** | Hardware security modules, certificate handling, key rotation | Microsoft cloud environments |

After securing your secrets in storage platforms, make use of secret management features that come with your CI/CD tools.

### CI/CD Secret Management

Many CI/CD tools come with built-in secret management capabilities:

-   **GitHub Actions**: Offers encrypted secrets at both the repository and organization levels. Secrets are automatically masked in logs and only accessible to authorized workflows.
-   **GitLab CI**: Provides protected variables and group-level secrets, allowing secure sharing across projects while maintaining isolation.
-   **Jenkins**: Works with credentials plugins and supports external secret stores. Plugins are required to ensure secrets are masked in logs.

### [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) Security Features

Capgo enhances the security of live updates in Capacitor apps by extending standard CI/CD secret management. It uses end-to-end encryption to ensure only authorized users can decrypt sensitive data [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

Capgo integrates seamlessly with tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins. It also supports channel-based distribution and role-based access controls, meeting the update requirements of both Apple and Android platforms.

## Secrets in Version Control

Protect your repositories by preventing hard-coded credentials from slipping through. Start with secure vault storage, then add extra safeguards to block sensitive information in your code.

Here’s how you can tighten your defenses:

-   **Use tools like [git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) or pre-commit frameworks** to catch issues before commits are made.
-   **Run periodic scans** with tools such as [truffleHog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog) or [GitGuardian](https://www.gitguardian.com/) to detect any secrets that may have slipped through.
-   **Automate CI/CD checks** to flag and fail builds if secrets are found.

Up next, we’ll cover how to handle exposed secrets effectively.

## Summary

This guide explored vault storage, automated scans, CI/CD tool integration, and repository protections. Capgo brings together security and fast deployment through end-to-end encryption and smooth CI/CD integration[\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

Key points for secure secret management:

-   **Use vault storage**: Rely on platforms that provide encryption both during storage and transit.
-   **Automate security checks**: Implement scanning tools to identify secret exposures early.
-   **Track and monitor activity**: Keep detailed audit logs of secret access and modifications.
-   **Prepare for incidents**: Set up clear processes for addressing exposed secrets and rolling back changes when necessary.

Effective secret management shifts security from being an obstacle to becoming a support system for continuous delivery.
