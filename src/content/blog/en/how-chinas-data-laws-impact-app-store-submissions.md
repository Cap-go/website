China's strict data laws make it challenging for app developers to enter the market. Here's what you need to know:

-   **Key Laws**: Developers must comply with the [Cybersecurity Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersecurity_Law_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China) (2017), [Data Security Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Security_Law_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China) (2021), and [Personal Information Protection Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Information_Protection_Law_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China) (PIPL, 2021). These laws require [local data storage](https://capgo.app/plugins/capacitor-data-storage-sqlite/), user consent, and strict controls on cross-border data transfers.
-   **App Design Adjustments**: Apps must store Chinese user data locally, disable features involving cross-border transfers, and ensure compliance from the start.
-   **Compliance Steps**: Implement local data storage solutions, classify data by sensitivity, and secure permissions for transfers. Tools like [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) help manage updates while meeting these requirements.

**Quick Tip**: Balancing compliance with app functionality is critical. Use secure tools and local hosting to meet regulatory demands without compromising user experience.

## China's Main Data Laws

China's data laws emphasize local data storage and impose tight restrictions on cross-border transfers - posing challenges for apps operating in the region.

### 3 Core Data Protection Laws

-   **Cybersecurity Law**: Introduced in 2017, this law requires data to be stored within China and mandates security reviews for any data transferred abroad.
-   **Data Security Law**: Effective as of 2021, it obligates organizations to classify data and protect critical information.
-   **Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL)**: Enacted in late 2021, this law governs how personal data is collected and processed, requiring clear and explicit consent from users.

These laws collectively define the framework for data handling practices that apps must follow to stay compliant.

### Data Storage and Transfer Rules

Under these regulations, data must remain within China unless it passes strict security assessments for cross-border transfers. These rules have a direct impact on how apps are designed, making regulatory compliance a vital part of the development process from the start.

## App Store Submission Requirements

China's rules on data localization require apps to meet specific design standards for approval in the app store. Here's what needs to be adjusted:

### App Design Changes

-   **Data Routing**: Ensure all data from Chinese users is stored on local or region-specific servers. This helps avoid any cross-border data transfers that might violate regulations.
-   **Feature Adjustments**: Modify or disable features that involve cross-border data sharing to stay compliant.

Capgo can help by allowing you to push updates and features instantly, using end-to-end encryption and customizable local data storage.

## Meeting Compliance Standards

Navigating compliance in China requires addressing both technical and regulatory challenges. Below, we break down the key setups and methods to align with these requirements while supporting practical development goals.

### Local Data Storage Setup

Here are some storage options to meet China's local data requirements:

| Storage Solution | Advantages | Challenges |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cloud Services** | Easy setup, managed compliance | Higher costs over time |
| **Self-hosted Infrastructure** | Greater control, customizable | Complex maintenance, longer setup |

It's crucial to implement redundancy and disaster recovery plans to ensure data sovereignty is maintained.

### Data Assessment Methods

Before managing updates, it's important to evaluate your data flow and control systems to ensure compliance. Key steps include:

-   **Data Classification**: Organize information by sensitivity levels.
-   **Transfer Patterns**: Map out how data flows between systems or components.
-   **Access Controls**: Clearly document who has access to different types of data.

## App Store Review Guide

Submitting apps to Chinese app stores involves navigating strict technical and regulatory requirements. Developers can reduce delays by [implementing an update system](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/hybrid-update) designed to comply with these regulations. This approach complements earlier strategies for managing local data and ensuring efficient updates.

### Submission Tips

For smoother updates and compliance, consider using Capgo. This tool allows developers to deliver updates directly to users while adhering to regulatory standards through secure deployment methods.

## Looking Ahead

### Expected Law Changes

China's data protection rules are shifting. Upcoming regulations might impose stricter data localization and handling requirements. App developers should gear up for tighter security audits and more demanding data protocols to stay compliant. These changes push developers to adjust their strategies, balancing global operations with local rules.

### Global vs Local Requirements

Distributing apps globally while following China's regulations calls for careful planning. Many developers rely on local servers in China combined with cloud solutions for other regions. This setup ensures compliance with local laws while maintaining global functionality. It builds on earlier localized data storage strategies, creating a system that works for both Chinese laws and international needs.

### New Compliance Tools

New compliance tools are making it easier to handle complex regulations while keeping update processes smooth. These tools are designed to adapt to changing rules and offer features that simplify compliance.

Some standout features include:

-   **End-to-end encryption** to secure data during transmission
-   **Flexible hosting options**, whether cloud-based or self-hosted
-   **Privacy-focused analytics** for better insights without compromising user data
