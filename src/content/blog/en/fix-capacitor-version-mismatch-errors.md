**Version mismatch errors in [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) apps can disrupt builds, cause runtime crashes, and delay updates.** These issues arise when core packages, plugins, or dependencies are misaligned. Here's how to quickly resolve them:

-   **Common Causes**:
    
    -   Partial updates or dependency conflicts.
    -   Errors in `package.json` or pod files.
    -   [Automatic updates](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/auto-update/) creating inconsistencies.
-   **Quick Fixes**:
    
    -   Run `npx cap doctor` or `npm list @capacitor/*` to spot mismatches.
    -   Align versions in `package.json` (e.g., `@capacitor/core`, `@capacitor/ios`, `@capacitor/android`).
    -   Use `npm install` to update all core packages and plugins.
-   **Prevent Future Issues**:
    
    -   Lock versions in `package.json` (e.g., `"@capacitor/core": "5.0.0"`).
    -   Automate version checks with CI/CD tools.
    -   Use live update tools like [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) for faster fixes.

## Finding Version Mismatch Problems

You can uncover version mismatches using these steps:

### Error Signs and Messages

Start by examining error outputs:

-   Build failures mentioning "incompatible version"
-   Runtime exceptions referring to "version mismatch"
-   Console warnings about dependency conflicts
-   iOS pod install errors highlighting version issues

These error messages, whether from the terminal or your IDE, often reveal conflicts. Pay attention to warnings that include version numbers - they can help you pinpoint the problem.

### Command Line Checks

Use command line tools to confirm version consistency:

-   **`npx cap doctor`**: Checks the health of Capacitor and flags mismatches.
-   **`npm list @capacitor/core @capacitor/ios @capacitor/android`**: Displays installed versions, making it easy to spot inconsistencies.

### Config File Review

Lastly, review your configuration files to ensure version alignment.

**package.json**

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@capacitor/core": "5.0.0",
    "@capacitor/ios": "5.0.0",
    "@capacitor/android": "5.0.1"  // Version mismatch!
  }
}
```

**capacitor.config.json**

```json
{
  "appId": "com.example.app",
  "appName": "MyApp",
  "plugins": {
    "SomePlugin": {
      "version": "3.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

Check for consistency across:

-   Core Capacitor packages
-   Platform-specific packages (iOS/Android)
-   Plugins and their dependencies

Keeping these versions aligned helps avoid compatibility issues.

## Fixing Core and Plugin Versions

### Core Package Updates

To update your core Capacitor packages, use the following npm command:

```bash
npm install @capacitor/core@latest @capacitor/ios@latest @capacitor/android@latest
```

If you need a specific version, replace `@latest` with the desired version number. For example:

```bash
npm install @capacitor/core@5.0.0 @capacitor/ios@5.0.0 @capacitor/android@5.0.0
```

Once the updates are complete, sync your project with:

```bash
npx cap sync
```

### Plugin Version Fixes

Ensure your plugins are compatible with the Capacitor version you're using. Update them to tested and compatible versions, and make sure to test the functionality after each update.

If a plugin requires Capacitor 5.x but you're using 6.x, you have two options:

-   Update the plugin to the latest version:
    
    ```bash
    npm install @plugin-name@latest
    ```
    
-   Downgrade Capacitor to match the plugin's requirements:
    
    ```bash
    npm install @capacitor/core@5.x
    ```
    

For updates that involve breaking changes, additional adjustments may be necessary.

### Major Version Changes

When transitioning to a new major version, follow these steps:

1.  **Backup Your Project**: Create a full backup before starting any updates.
    
2.  **Check the Changelog**: Review the official changelog for any breaking changes that may affect your project.
    
3.  **Update Dependencies**: Upgrade your Capacitor packages to the required versions. For example:
    
    ```bash
    npm install @capacitor/core@7.0.0 @capacitor/ios@7.0.0 @capacitor/android@7.0.0
    ```
    

Capgo provides live updates for Capacitor 6 and 7, allowing you to apply fixes without needing app store approvals [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

## Avoiding Future Version Conflicts

### Version Lock Tools

Lock files like `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` help ensure everyone on your team uses the same dependency versions. To avoid unexpected updates, define exact version numbers instead of using caret (`^`) or tilde (`~`) symbols:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@capacitor/core": "5.0.0",
    "@capacitor/ios": "5.0.0",
    "@capacitor/android": "5.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Automating Updates

Set up automated version checks in your CI/CD pipeline to flag conflicts early. For example, use the following command to check for outdated dependencies:

```bash
npm outdated @capacitor/*
```

You can integrate this step into tools like [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions), [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), or [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) to ensure consistent builds. For even more control, consider using Capgo's update system to simplify the process.
