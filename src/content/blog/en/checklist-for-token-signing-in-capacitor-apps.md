Token signing is essential for securing [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) apps, ensuring data integrity, authentication, and compliance with U.S. security standards. This guide provides a clear checklist for setup, implementation, and risk management.

**Key Steps for Token Signing:**

-   Choose a secure cryptographic library (e.g., [CryptoJS](https://cryptojs.gitbook.io/docs), [jose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jose), [libsodium](https://doc.libsodium.org/)).
-   Use secure key storage (iOS: [Secure Enclave](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-enclave-sec59b0b31ff/web)/[Keychain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain_\(software\)); Android: [Keystore](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/keystore)).
-   Define token payload fields (`iss`, `exp`, `sub`, custom claims).
-   Select a signing algorithm (HS256, RS256, ES256).
-   Sign and verify tokens securely.

**Security Best Practices:**

-   Set token expiration to 15 minutes.
-   Rotate signing keys every 30 days.
-   Validate all token fields.
-   Protect private keys in platform-specific secure stores.

**Live Updates:**

-   Use signed tokens to [secure updates](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/hybrid-update/).
-   Enable rollback options for compromised updates.
-   Monitor user engagement and update success rates.

**Compliance Requirements:**

-   Align with U.S. mandates like CCPA, HIPAA, NIST SP 800‑63, and FIPS 140‑2.
-   Encrypt tokens containing sensitive data and ensure secure key management.

Token signing ensures secure live updates while meeting regulatory standards. Follow these steps to protect your app and users.

## Required Setup for Token Signing

To ensure secure token signing, focus on two key areas:

1.  **Choosing and validating your cryptographic toolkit**:
    
    -   Pick a reliable library such as _CryptoJS_, _jose_, or _libsodium_.
    -   Confirm the library is actively maintained and undergoes regular security audits.
    -   Look into its adoption within the developer community.
    -   Review its vulnerability history to assess potential risks.
2.  **Implementing secure key storage**:
    
    -   For iOS, use Secure Enclave or Keychain.
    -   For Android, rely on the Keystore System.
    -   Check for compliance with FIPS 140-2 standards.
    -   Ensure the solution holds a Common Criteria certification.

These decisions play a critical role in maintaining **authentication** and **integrity**. They ensure that every signed token aligns with U.S. compliance standards and supports both current and future security needs.

In systems requiring live updates, following these practices has shown a 95% success rate in deployments [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

## Token Signing Implementation Steps

To ensure secure token signing and verification, follow these steps:

-   **Define the token's payload fields**: Include fields like `iss` (issuer), `exp` (expiration), `sub` (subject), and any custom claims needed.
-   **Choose a signing algorithm**: Decide between options like HS256 or RS256 and configure it accordingly.
-   **Handle the private key securely**: Load or generate the private key in **Keychain** for iOS or **Keystore** for Android.
-   **Sign the token**: Use your preferred cryptographic library to sign the token.
-   **Verify the token's signature**: Always validate the signature before processing any update payload.

These steps help maintain the security and reliability of your token-based live update process.

## Security Guidelines and Risks

When implementing signing, it's crucial to address potential misuse and vulnerabilities. Here's how to stay secure:

### Token Security Rules

-   Set token expiration to a maximum of **15 minutes**.
-   Rotate signing keys every **30 days** to reduce exposure.
-   Ensure all token fields are validated before processing.
-   Store private keys exclusively in **secure platform keystores**.

### Common Security Risks

-   **Key leakage** caused by improper storage or transmission methods.
-   **Token replay attacks** where valid tokens are intercepted and reused.
-   **Algorithm manipulation** that bypasses signature verification.

### Comparing Signing Algorithms

-   **HS256**: Uses a shared secret for symmetric signing. Best suited for environments where all parties are trusted.
-   **RS256**: Employs public/private keypairs for asymmetric signing, making it ideal for distributed systems.
-   **ES256**: Utilizes elliptic curve cryptography for strong security with smaller key sizes.

## Live Update Security

Ensuring secure live updates involves using signed tokens, verifying data integrity, and meeting store-compliance standards. This builds on the token-signing process described earlier, extending it into live-update workflows.

### Token Security for Updates

In live-update scenarios, signed tokens protect each update package from its source to the device. Here are some key practices to follow:

-   Allow detailed tester permissions and enable one-click rollback options.
-   Monitor update success rates and user engagement as they happen.
-   Manage testers and beta users with precise permission settings.

Platforms like [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) implement these practices with features like encryption, signature checks, version control, and rollback options to secure over-the-air (OTA) updates. These methods have proven effective, with 95% of active users receiving updates within 24 hours [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

### Security Implementation

To implement token signing for live updates, focus on the following:

-   Manage signing keys securely for update packages.
-   Use version control paired with cryptographic verification.
-   Automate signature validation directly on devices.
-   Offer immediate rollback options for any compromised updates.

This ensures only authenticated and properly signed updates are delivered to users, while also adhering to platform requirements.

## U.S. Standards and Requirements

To comply with U.S. regulatory requirements, integrate live-update token practices into your processes. Ensure your token signing methods align with key U.S. mandates like **CCPA** for consumer privacy, **HIPAA** for health data protection, **NIST SP 800‑63** for identity verification, and **FIPS 140‑2** for cryptographic modules [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

Here’s how these standards apply to token signing:

-   **CCPA**: Ensure token payloads respect user consent and support data deletion requests.
-   **HIPAA**: Encrypt tokens containing Protected Health Information (PHI) both at rest and during transmission.
-   **NIST SP 800‑63**: Use [multi-factor authentication](https://capgo.app/docs/webapp/mfa/) to secure access to signing keys.
-   **FIPS 140‑2**: Confirm that your signing library uses validated cryptographic modules.

[\[1\]](https://capgo.app/) Developers should stay informed about U.S. federal and state data protection laws, including CCPA.

## Conclusion

Secure token signing and live-update integration are crucial for maintaining your Capacitor app's integrity and meeting compliance requirements.

Refer to the checklist provided to ensure your implementation adheres to security standards and U.S. regulations.

### Key Points to Remember

-   Ensure token signing aligns with U.S. regulations like CCPA and HIPAA, and use strong encryption methods.
-   Implement version control and allow instant rollbacks for updates to maintain stability.
-   Monitor and improve the speed of signing and update delivery processes.
