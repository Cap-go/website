## Core Error Handling Guidelines

Effective error handling in Capacitor apps requires balancing user experience with technical functionality. These guidelines help manage errors across platforms efficiently.

### Writing Clear Error Messages

Good error messages should include three essential elements:

| Element | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Context** | Specify where the error happened | "Unable to save profile photo" |
| **Cause** | Explain why the error occurred | "Photo size exceeds 5 MB limit" |
| **Solution** | Offer actionable next steps | "Please choose a smaller image or compress the current one" |

Use plain, understandable language while being technically accurate. For instance, instead of saying "HTTP 404 – Resource Not Found", try "We couldn't find the page. Check the URL or return home."

### Platform-Wide Error Standards

Ensuring consistent error handling across platforms involves a cohesive strategy:

-   **Centralized Error Catalog**: Maintain a single repository for all error messages and codes to ensure consistency.
-   **Platform-Specific Handlers**: Use native error handling tools while keeping the messaging uniform.
-   **Error Severity Levels**: Classify errors by their impact and the actions users need to take.

### Error Prevention Methods

1\. **Input Validation**  
Validate user inputs with real-time checks, ensuring proper data types and formats (e.g., email addresses or phone numbers).

2\. **Network Status Monitoring**  
Track network connectivity to prevent API errors. When offline, you can:

-   Cache important data for offline use.
-   Queue user actions for later processing.
-   Display clear indicators for connectivity status.

3\. **Graceful Degradation**  
Support graceful degradation by:

-   Falling back to local storage during cloud sync issues.
-   Offering offline modes for critical tasks.
-   Providing alternative ways to complete actions when full functionality isn't available.

Following these steps helps create a reliable, user-friendly app experience while handling errors consistently across platforms. Proactive measures like these ensure smoother functioning and build user trust.

## Handling Different Error Types

### Form and Input Validation

Using a layered approach to input validation can improve user interactions while reducing errors. Provide clear, immediate feedback to users as they interact with the form:

| **Validation Type** | **Implementation** | **User Feedback** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Required Fields** | Check input as the user types | Highlight with a red asterisk and inline error message |
| **Format Validation** | Use regex patterns | Display examples of valid formats |
| **Cross-field Validation** | Check related fields together | Highlight both fields if they conflict |
| **Custom Rules** | Apply business logic checks | Provide a clear explanation of any special requirements |

To make the process smoother:

-   Display format guidelines before users start typing.
-   Validate inputs progressively as they are entered.
-   Conduct a final validation when the form is submitted.

While these measures address input-level mistakes, managing network and API errors is equally critical for maintaining a smooth user experience.

### Connection and API Issues

Network and API errors can disrupt user interactions, so it's essential to monitor connections and handle API responses effectively:

1.  **Network Status Monitoring**  
    Keep track of connectivity to enable offline caching, queue operations for later, and update the user interface with the current status.
    
2.  **API Error Management**
    
    | **Error Code** | **User-Facing Message** | **Background Action** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 401/403 | "Please log in again to continue" | Refresh authentication tokens |
    | 404 | "The requested information isn't available" | Clear invalid cache entries |
    | 429 | "Please try again in a few minutes" | Use exponential backoff for retrying |
    | 500+ | "We're experiencing technical difficulties" | Log error details for debugging purposes |
    

By combining these strategies, you can minimize disruptions caused by connectivity issues and ensure users remain informed.

### Platform-Specific Problems

Each platform comes with its own set of challenges, requiring tailored solutions to address unique issues effectively.

**iOS-Specific Handling**:

-   Manage permissions, memory constraints, and keyboard interactions.
