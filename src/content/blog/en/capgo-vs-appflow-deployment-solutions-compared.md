**Looking for the best tool for Over-the-Air (OTA) [app updates](https://capgo.app/plugins/capacitor-updater/)?** Here's a quick breakdown: [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) delivers updates instantly with end-to-end encryption and flexible hosting options, while [Appflow](https://ionic.io/appflow/), a long-standing solution, is set to shut down in 2026 and comes with higher costs.

### Key Takeaways:

-   **Capgo**: Affordable, secure, supports [cloud and self-hosted setups](https://capgo.app/blog/self-hosted-capgo/), and integrates with external CI/CD tools like [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions). Plans start at $12/month.
-   **Appflow**: Proprietary, cloud-only, higher costs ($5,000/year for some teams), and [built-in CI/CD](https://capgo.app/blog/setup-ci-and-cd-gitlab/).

### Quick Comparison:

| Feature | Capgo | Appflow |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Launch Year** | 2022 | Long-standing, ending 2026 |
| **Hosting Options** | Cloud or self-hosted | Cloud-only |
| **Security** | End-to-end encryption | Update signing |
| **Pricing** | From $12/month | ~$5,000/year for teams |
| **CI/CD Integration** | External tools supported | Built-in system |

Capgo stands out for its affordability, strong security, and flexibility, making it a top choice for developers seeking fast, [secure updates](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/hybrid-update) without breaking the bank.

## Feature Comparison

### Update Systems

Capgo and Appflow take different paths when it comes to managing app updates. Capgo zeroes in on web asset updates, allowing developers to instantly push changes without waiting for app store approvals. It uses a channel system to make updates more targeted, letting developers roll out changes to specific user groups for beta testing or phased deployments [\[1\]](https://capgo.app).

One standout feature of Capgo's update system is its ability to send only the modified parts of an update. This approach reduces both bandwidth usage and the time it takes to deliver updates [\[1\]](https://capgo.app).

### Security Standards

When it comes to security, Capgo and Appflow take different approaches. Capgo uses end-to-end encryption for all updates, while Appflow relies mainly on update signing [\[1\]](https://capgo.app). Both platforms meet Apple and Google requirements, but their methods of safeguarding data stand apart:

| Security Feature | Capgo | Appflow |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Update Protection](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/hybrid-update/) | End-to-end encryption | Update signing |
| Hosting Options | Cloud or self-hosted | SaaS only |
| Source Code Access | 100% open-source | Proprietary |
| Store Compliance | Full compliance | Full compliance |

Capgo's focus on encryption and flexibility in hosting options adds another layer of control for developers handling sensitive data.

### Platform Architecture

Capgoâ€™s open-source architecture is built for flexibility, supporting both cloud-based and [self-hosted deployments](https://capgo.app/blog/self-hosted-capgo/). Its global CDN ensures impressive performance, delivering a 5 MB bundle download in just 114 ms [\[1\]](https://capgo.app). This efficiency is backed by real-world results: Capgo has delivered 1.6 trillion updates and supports over 1,700 apps currently in production [\[1\]](https://capgo.app).

Capgo also integrates smoothly with CI/CD pipelines like GitHub Actions and [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/). Developers can set up these pipelines without extra hosting costs, giving them more control over their deployment processes [\[1\]](https://capgo.app).

## Price Comparison

### Plan Options

Capgo offers four pricing tiers, each designed to cater to different needs and budgets. The **SOLO** plan starts at $12 per month (with annual billing), while the **PAYG** tier, which includes enterprise-level features, is priced at $249 per month.

| Feature | Capgo SOLO | [Capgo MAKER](https://capgo.app/imprint/) | [Capgo TEAM](https://capgo.app/consulting/) | [Capgo PAYG](https://capgo.app/docs/webapp/payment/) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Price ($/month, annual billing)** | $12 | $33 | $83 | $249 |
| **MAU Limit** | 1,000 | 10,000 | 100,000 | 1,000,000 |
| **Bandwidth** | 50 GB | 500 GB | 2,000 GB | 10 TB |
| **Storage** | 2 GB | 5 GB | 10 GB | 20 GB |

These tiers are structured to scale with your team's growth, offering flexibility and competitive pricing.

### Small Team Pricing

For startups and smaller teams, Capgo's pricing stands out as a cost-effective alternative to traditional solutions. While platforms like Appflow can cost thousands annually, Capgo provides a more budget-friendly option. Its CI/CD setup requires a one-time fee of $2,600, with ongoing monthly costs averaging $300 [\[1\]](https://capgo.app).

> "We are currently giving a try to @Capgo since Appcenter stopped live updates support on hybrid apps and @AppFlow is way too expensive." - Simon Flack [\[1\]](https://capgo.app)

Hereâ€™s what makes Capgo appealing for small teams:

-   A **15-day free trial** with no credit card required
-   Flexible scaling to match your usage needs
-   No annual contracts - pay as you go
-   A self-hosted option for better cost management

## Development Tools

### Build Automation

Capgo and Appflow tackle build automation and CI/CD integration in distinct ways. Capgo focuses on flexibility by working seamlessly with external CI/CD platforms like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/). This approach lets developers use the tools theyâ€™re already comfortable with. So far, Capgo has successfully configured CI/CD pipelines for over 50 apps, simplifying deployment processes significantly [\[1\]](https://capgo.app).

Hereâ€™s a quick comparison of the two platforms:

| Feature | Capgo | Appflow |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CI/CD Integration | Works with external platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Jenkins | Comes with a built-in system |
| Operating Cost | Around US$300 per month | Roughly US$6,000 per year |

Now, letâ€™s look at how these platforms handle collaboration and team workflows.

### Team Tools

Both Capgo and Appflow include features designed to improve collaboration, but they approach this differently. Capgo provides detailed user permissions, support for [multiple organizations](https://capgo.app/docs/webapp/organization-system/), and a sophisticated channel system for delivering targeted updates. Additionally, Capgo offers a public API, enabling teams to integrate it with their existing tools and workflows. This setup ensures development teams can operate efficiently while keeping updates organized and streamlined [\[1\]](https://capgo.app).
