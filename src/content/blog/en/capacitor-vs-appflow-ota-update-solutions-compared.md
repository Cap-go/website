**Looking for the best OTA update solution for your app?** Here's a quick comparison of [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) (with [Capgo](https://capgo.app/)) and [Appflow](https://ionic.io/appflow/) to help you decide. [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) offers fast updates, high security, and cost-effective options, while Appflow is tied to the [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) ecosystem and is set to shut down in 2026.

### Key Points:

-   **Capacitor (Capgo)**:
    
    -   Updates reach 95% of users in 24 hours.
    -   Offers end-to-end encryption and flexible hosting (cloud or self-hosted).
    -   Costs ~$3,600 annually, with a one-time setup fee of $2,600.
    -   Actively developed and open-source.
-   **Appflow**:
    
    -   Integrated with Ionic but cloud-only.
    -   Scheduled to end support in 2026.
    -   Costs $6,000 annually.

### Quick Comparison:

| Feature | Capacitor (Capgo) | Appflow |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Update Speed** | 95% in 24 hours, 434ms API | Varies |
| **Security** | End-to-end encryption | Standard signing |
| **Hosting** | Cloud or self-hosted | Cloud-only |
| **Future Availability** | Actively developed | Ends in 2026 |
| **Annual Cost** | ~$3,600 | $6,000 |
| **Setup Fee** | $2,600 | Included |

**Bottom line:** Capacitor (Capgo) is a future-proof, secure, and cost-efficient choice, especially for long-term projects. Appflow may suit short-term needs but requires migration planning due to its upcoming shutdown.

## [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) Update Features

![Capacitor](https://assets.seobotai.com/capgo.app/67e88f5c283d21cbd67a8bd9/7e137b9b90adb3934b29b03381f213c1.jpg)

### Built-in Update System

Capacitor's update system lets developers deliver live bug fixes and new features directly to users, skipping the usual app store review delays. When properly set up, this system can reach up to 95% of active users within 24 hours [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/). It uses differential updates, which only download the changed parts of the code, saving bandwidth and speeding up the process. For instance, downloading a 5MB update via Capgo's global CDN can take just 114 milliseconds [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/). This streamlined approach fits seamlessly into modern development workflows.

### Development Tools Support

Capacitor's update system works hand-in-hand with various development tools to simplify deployment. CLI tools make building and deploying updates easier, while compatibility with CI/CD platforms like [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions), [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), and [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) automates the entire process. Additional features like version control, error tracking, and analytics dashboards let developers monitor updates in real time, troubleshoot issues, and measure performance effectively.

### [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) Platform Features

![Capgo](https://assets.seobotai.com/capgo.app/67e88f5c283d21cbd67a8bd9/93c1d42fe1ebf1e9553e1e7f4f856f98.jpg)

The [Capgo platform](https://capgo.app/docs/webapp/) enhances Capacitor's update capabilities with added security and advanced deployment options. Having managed 23.5 million updates across 750 production apps [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/), it provides key features to improve performance:

| Feature | Capability | Performance Metric |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Update Success Rate | Global deployment | 82% worldwide |
| API Response Time | Real-time operations | 434 ms average |
| Security | End-to-end encryption | Full update protection |
| Distribution | [Channel system](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/channel-system/) | Targeted rollouts |

Capgo's channel system enables precise update distribution, such as running beta tests or rolling out updates in stages, without compromising security. Teams can choose between cloud-hosted and self-hosted setups, gaining full control with tools like one-click rollbacks and proactive error monitoring.

## [Appflow](https://ionic.io/appflow/) Update System

![Appflow](https://assets.seobotai.com/capgo.app/67e88f5c283d21cbd67a8bd9/d621f8c4ec61e7471b0153517889f4cc.jpg)

### [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) Platform Connection

![Ionic](https://assets.seobotai.com/capgo.app/67e88f5c283d21cbd67a8bd9/e144b5b930d9d793c665f9f08c6b1196.jpg)

Appflow works directly with Ionic's build system to package and distribute [app updates](https://capgo.app/plugins/capacitor-updater/) efficiently.

### Update Automation Tools

Appflow includes cloud-based tools for automating builds, managing pipelines, and handling version control. However, users have noted some challenges with its code-push functionality.

> "Cancelled my @Appflow subscription after 4 years. Code-Push never seemed to work well, hopefully @CapGO has it figured out" - LeVar Berry [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

### Appflow End-of-Life Plans

Ionic has announced that Appflow will be discontinued in 2026, urging users to plan migrations now to avoid disruptions.

> "Jumped over to @Capgo after @AppFlow hit us with a $5000 bill for the year to continue. Loving CapoGo so far. Thanks for @Capgo, it's a great product." - jermaine [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)
