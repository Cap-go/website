## Setting Up OTA Updates

Set up OTA updates in Capgo to streamline your deployment process. Follow these steps and tips for a hassle-free configuration.

### Basic Setup Steps

Start by installing the Capgo plugin in your Capacitor project:

```typescript
npm install @capgo/capacitor-updater
npx cap sync
```

Next, update your `capacitor.config.json` file with your [Capgo API key](https://capgo.app/docs/webapp/api-keys/):

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "CapacitorUpdater": {
      "autoUpdate": true,
      "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    }
  }
}
```

Then, initialize the updater in your app's main file to detect updates:

```typescript
import { CapacitorUpdater } from '@capgo/capacitor-updater';
await CapacitorUpdater.notifyAppReady();
```

Once this is done, you can set up channels to manage different update streams.

### Update Channel Setup

Organize your [update channels](https://capgo.app/docs/webapp/channels/) to suit your deployment needs:

| Channel Type | Purpose | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Production | Stable releases | General user base |
| Staging | Pre-release testing | QA team and beta testers |
| Beta | Feature testing | Early adopters |

To upload an update to a specific channel, use the [Capgo CLI](https://capgo.app/docs/cli/commands):

```bash
npx @capgo/cli upload -c production
```

### Update Methods

Capgo provides two main ways to handle updates:

**[Automatic Updates](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/auto-update/)**  
Enable automatic updates by setting `autoUpdate: true` in your configuration. This ensures updates are applied in the background with no extra effort from developers.

**[Manual Updates](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/manual-update/)**  
For more control, you can manage updates manually. Use the following pattern to check for and apply updates:

```typescript
// Check for updates
const update = await CapacitorUpdater.download();

// Install when ready
if (update) {
  await CapacitorUpdater.set(update);
}
```

For critical updates, you can prompt users before proceeding:

```typescript
if (update.version > currentVersion) {
  const userConsent = await showUpdatePrompt();
  if (userConsent) {
    await CapacitorUpdater.set(update);
  }
}
```

You can also target specific user groups with custom IDs and channels:

```typescript
await CapacitorUpdater.setCustomId('beta-tester-123');
await CapacitorUpdater.setChannel('beta');
```

Finally, make sure to include error handling and rollback options:

```typescript
try {
  await CapacitorUpdater.set(update);
} catch (error) {
  await CapacitorUpdater.reset(); // Revert to the last working version
  console.error('Update failed:', error);
}
```

With these steps, your OTA update system is ready to go. Explore advanced settings to customize the update process further.

## Advanced Settings

Improve your [Capgo OTA update](https://web.capgo.app/resend_email) setup with added security measures and flexible update configurations. These options ensure a secure and smooth update experience while meeting app store guidelines.

### Security Features

Capgo provides strong security protocols to safeguard your update bundles and deliver them securely to users. The platform uses end-to-end encryption with public-key cryptography for all updates [\[1\]](https://github.com/Cap-go/capacitor-updater). Below is how you can enable key security features:

```typescript
// Enable bundle verification
await CapacitorUpdater.setVerifyBundles(true);

// Configure encryption settings
await CapacitorUpdater.configure({
  encryption: {
    enabled: true,
    failOnError: true
  }
});
```

Key components of the bundle protection system include:

| Security Feature | Description | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[Bundle Integrity](https://capgo.app/docs/webapp/bundles/)** | Verifies package authenticity with cryptographic signatures | Automatically enabled with setVerifyBundles() |
| **Rollback Protection** | Reverts to a stable version if an update fails | Built into the update process |
| **Access Control** | Manages updates with role-based permissions | Configured via the dashboard |

### Update Behavior Settings

You can customize how updates are delivered and installed by using event listeners and configuration options. Adjust the timing and user interaction for updates with these settings:

```typescript
// Listen for when an update is available
CapacitorUpdater.addListener('updateAvailable', async (info) => {
  if (info.version > currentVersion) {
    // Custom update logic based on app state
    const isAppInactive = await checkAppState();
    if (isAppInactive) {
      await CapacitorUpdater.download();
    }
  }
});

// Monitor download completion
CapacitorUpdater.addListener('downloadComplete', (info) => {
  console.log(`Update ${info.version} ready to install`);
  // Implement custom installation timing if desired
});
```

For phased rollouts, you can configure update distribution directly through the dashboard or with code:

```typescript
// Set custom update conditions for a gradual rollout
await CapacitorUpdater.configure({
  rollout: {
    percentage: 25, // Start with 25% of users
    timeInterval: 24 // Increase rollout percentage every 24 hours
  }
});
```

To handle specific version-related behaviors:

```typescript
// Handle version-specific update failures
CapacitorUpdater.addListener('updateFailed', async (info) => {
  if (info.error.code === 'VERSION_MISMATCH') {
    await CapacitorUpdater.reset(); // Revert to the last stable version
    // Optionally, handle error notification here
  }
});
```

These settings ensure updates are reliable while allowing you to tailor the process to your app's needs. Always test updates thoroughly in Capgo's staging environment before rolling them out to production [\[2\]](https://dev.to/arnosolo/ionic-appflow-live-update-alternative-55c3).

## Problem Solving Guide

Capgo's error logs and built-in tools help tackle OTA update challenges while keeping your app compliant with store requirements.

### Common Issues and Solutions

Here are some typical problems and how to address them:

-   **Failed Downloads**  
    _Symptoms_: Downloads freeze or fail to complete.  
    _Solution_: Check your network connection, confirm the update URL is valid, and add retry mechanisms to handle interruptions.
    
-   **Version Conflicts**  
    _Symptoms_: Updates either fail to install or cause app instability.  
    _Solution_: Use clear version numbers to avoid conflicts and implement rollback options for safety.
    
-   **Installation Errors**  
    _Symptoms_: Updates fail or trigger automatic rollbacks.  
    _Solution_: Ensure you call `notifyAppReady()` after a successful update to prevent rollbacks.
    

For updates larger than 50MB, splitting them into smaller files can improve performance on Android devices [\[5\]](https://github.com/Cap-go/capacitor-updater/issues/119).

Use detailed error logging to catch problems early. For example, implement this listener:

```typescript
CapacitorUpdater.addListener('updateFailed', (error) => {
  console.log(`Update failed: ${error.code}`);
  logUpdateError({
    errorCode: error.code,
    deviceInfo: error.device,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
});
```

By combining error logging with pre-checks, you can handle these issues effectively before focusing on compliance.

### App Store Rules

Technical fixes alone aren't enough - your updates also need to align with app store guidelines.

**Apple App Store Requirements**:

-   _User Transparency_: Clearly inform users about the update's content and get their consent.
-   _Core Functionality_: Ensure your app's main features remain intact as reviewed.
-   _Security Measures_: Use secure methods for transmitting updates.

**Android Implementation**:

```typescript
await CapacitorUpdater.configure({
  updateNotification: {
    title: "Update Available",
    message: "A new version is available. Please update to access the latest features.",
    requireUserConsent: true
  }
});
```

**Best Practices**:

-   _Version Control_: Roll out updates gradually to reduce conflicts.
-   _Update Notifications_: Provide clear and user-friendly update alerts.
-   _Security_: Verify the bundle's integrity and use encryption to protect data.
