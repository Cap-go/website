## Setup and Installation

To start developing a [Capacitor Android plugin](https://capgo.app/plugins/ivs-player/), you’ll need to set up your environment carefully. Here’s how to get everything ready.

### Required Tools Setup

Make sure you have the following tools installed and configured:

-   **Node.js and npm**: Install Node.js version 14.0 or higher.
-   **[Java Development Kit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit) (JDK)**: Use JDK 11 or newer.
-   **Android Studio**: Install the latest stable version (2023.1.1 or later).
-   **Capacitor CLI**: Install globally using npm.
-   **Android SDK**: Ensure API level 22 or higher is installed.

Add these paths to your system’s environment variables:

```bash
ANDROID_HOME=/Users/username/Library/Android/sdk
JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.jdk/Contents/Home
```

Double-check that your environment variables are set up correctly to avoid compatibility issues. Once done, move on to configuring your Android Studio project.

### [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) Project Setup

![Android Studio](https://assets.seobotai.com/capgo.app/67e73f80283d21cbd679794c/37b29b854cd53ac189541dfdcf7a9a26.jpg)

Set up your Android Studio project with these steps:

1.  **Project Configuration**

Update your `build.gradle` file with the following settings:

```gradle
android {
    compileSdkVersion 33
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 22
        targetSdkVersion 33
    }
}
```

2.  **Add Plugin Dependencies**

Include the required Capacitor dependencies in your `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation '@capacitor/android:5.0.0'
    implementation '@capacitor/core:5.0.0'
}
```

3.  **Configure the Manifest File**

Add necessary permissions and settings to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <application
        android:allowBackup="true"
        android:label="@string/app_name">
        <!-- Additional configurations -->
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### Compatibility Table

Here’s a quick reference for the minimum and recommended versions of key components:

| Component | Minimum Version | Recommended Version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Android Studio | 2023.1.1 | 2023.2.1 |
| JDK | 11  | 17  |
| Gradle | 7.3 | 8.0 |
| Android SDK | API 22 | API 33 |

### Optimize [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) Settings

![Gradle](https://assets.seobotai.com/capgo.app/67e73f80283d21cbd679794c/ea42b2d6446e3f23d9417eaa9ba23d71.jpg)

To improve performance and compatibility, update your `gradle.properties` file with these settings:

```properties
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2048m
org.gradle.parallel=true
android.useAndroidX=true
```

Enable auto-import and real-time compilation in Android Studio to quickly identify and resolve issues. These steps ensure smooth development and efficient use of resources.

## Creating Your First Android Plugin

Learn how to build your first Android plugin using Capacitor. This guide walks you through the steps and shares practical tips.

### Plugin Creation Steps

Start by generating the plugin scaffold with the Capacitor CLI:

```bash
npm init @capacitor/plugin your-plugin-name
cd your-plugin-name
npm install
```

Next, update the `package.json` file with the following configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "your-plugin-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "capacitor": {
    "android": {
      "src": "android"
    }
  }
}
```

This setup ensures Capacitor recognizes your plugin and its Android source files.

### Plugin Directory Structure

Your project will follow this structure:

```
your-plugin-name/
├── android/
│   ├── src/main/
│   │   ├── java/com/yourcompany/plugin/
│   │   │   └── YourPlugin.java
│   ├── build.gradle
│   └── proguard-rules.pro
├── src/
│   ├── definitions.ts
│   └── web.ts
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

Here’s what each key file does:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `YourPlugin.java` | Handles the plugin's Android logic |
| `definitions.ts` | Contains TypeScript interface definitions |
| `web.ts` | Provides web-based fallback functionality |
| `package.json` | Manages plugin dependencies and metadata |

### Writing Plugin Methods

Define plugin methods in the `YourPlugin.java` file. For example, here's a simple method:

```java
@PluginMethod
public void echo(PluginCall call) {
    String value = call.getString("value");
    JSObject ret = new JSObject();
    ret.put("value", value);
    call.resolve(ret);
}
```

Each method requires the `@PluginMethod` annotation and uses the `PluginCall` object to handle parameters and return results. Here's another example with error handling:

```java
@PluginMethod
public void getData(PluginCall call) {
    String id = call.getString("id", null);
    if (id == null) {
        call.reject("Must provide an id");
        return;
    }

    int limit = call.getInt("limit", 10); // Default value

    JSObject result = new JSObject();
    result.put("id", id);
    result.put("limit", limit);
    call.resolve(result);
}
```

For more complex logic, handle exceptions to ensure stability:

```java
@PluginMethod
public void processData(PluginCall call) {
    try {
        // Processing logic here
        call.resolve();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        call.reject("Error processing data: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

Finally, register your plugin in the main activity:

```java
public class MainActivity extends BridgeActivity {
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        registerPlugin(YourPlugin.class);
    }
}
```

### Testing Your Plugin

Use Android Studio's [debugging tools](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/debugging/) to test each method thoroughly. Ensure that your methods are focused on specific tasks to keep the code clean and easy to maintain. Once debugging is complete, test your plugin on actual Android devices to confirm everything works as expected.

## Plugin Testing Guide

### Testing on Android Devices

To test Android plugins effectively, use both emulators and real devices. Android Studio's AVD Manager is a great tool for simulating various API levels and screen sizes.

Run these commands to prepare for testing:

```bash
npx cap open android
npm run build
npx cap sync
```

Make sure USB debugging is enabled and confirm device connectivity with `adb devices`. Create a test matrix to cover key Android versions:

| Android Version | Test Priority | Key Focus Areas |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Android 14 | High | Latest API compatibility |
| Android 13 | High | Core functionality |
| Android 12 | Medium | Backward compatibility |
| Android 11 | Low | Legacy support |

### Fixing Common Plugin Issues

**Memory Leaks**  
Use the Memory Profiler in Android Studio to identify and resolve memory leaks. Focus on:

-   Unregistered broadcast receivers
-   Unclosed database connections
-   Strong references to Activities or Contexts

**Plugin Registration Problems**  
If plugins fail to register, check the following:

-   Plugin registration in `MainActivity.java`
-   Consistency of the package name
-   Correct Gradle dependencies

**Performance Issues**  
Leverage the CPU Profiler to pinpoint performance bottlenecks. Best practices include:

-   Keeping plugin methods lightweight
-   Running heavy tasks on background threads
-   Adding proper error handling mechanisms

### Streamlining Live Testing and Updates

[Capgo tools](https://capgo.app/docs/cli/commands) can simplify live testing and updates. Use these examples to enhance your workflow:

-   **Initialize error tracking**:
    
    ```typescript
    CapacitorUpdater.notifyAppReady();
    ```
    
-   **Handle update failures**:
    
    ```typescript
    CapacitorUpdater.addListener('updateFailed', (info) => {
      console.error('Update failed:', info);
    });
    ```
    
-   **Use rollback for quick fixes**:
    
    ```typescript
    try {
      await CapacitorUpdater.rollback();
    } catch (err) {
      console.error('Rollback failed:', err);
    }
    ```
    
-   **Set up staged rollouts**:
    
    ```typescript
    await CapacitorUpdater.setChannel({
      channel: 'beta',
      preventAutoUpdateOnFail: true
    });
    ```
    

## Plugin Development Standards

### Code Structure Guidelines

Here’s a basic template for structuring your plugin in Java:

```java
public class MyPlugin extends Plugin {
    private static final String TAG = "MyPlugin";
    private final Context context;

    public MyPlugin(Context context) {
        this.context = context;
    }

    @PluginMethod
    public void methodName(PluginCall call) {
        try {
            // Method implementation
            call.resolve();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            call.reject("Error message", e);
        }
    }
}
```

Key structural practices to follow:

-   Use clear and well-defined method signatures with appropriate access modifiers.
-   Choose variable and method names that explain their purpose.
-   Ensure public APIs are fully documented.
-   Keep business logic separate from UI-related components.

### Performance Tips

A well-structured plugin not only improves maintainability but also boosts performance. Here are some optimization strategies:

| Area of Focus | Recommended Approach |
| --- | --- |
| Thread Management | Offload heavy tasks to background threads |
| Memory Usage | Clean up resources properly to avoid leaks |
| Network Calls | Cache responses and implement retry mechanisms |
| Resource Loading | Use lazy loading for large resources |

For tasks that demand significant resources, consider this example:

```java
@PluginMethod
public void heavyOperation(PluginCall call) {
    taskQueue.execute(() -> {
        try {
            // Perform intensive operation
            JSObject result = new JSObject();
            call.resolve(result);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            call.reject("Operation failed", e);
        }
    });
}
```

### Error Management

Strong error handling ensures your plugin remains stable and reliable:

```java
@PluginMethod
public void criticalOperation(PluginCall call) {
    try {
        // Operation code
        if (!operationSuccessful) {
            throw new PluginException("Operation failed");
        }
        call.resolve();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        Logger.error(TAG, "Critical operation failed", e);
        handleRollback();
        call.reject("Operation failed", e);
    }
}
```

Best practices for error management:

-   Log errors with the correct severity level.
-   Include meaningful context in error messages to aid debugging.
-   Monitor error frequency and identify recurring issues.
-   Use automated error reporting to catch issues early.

For critical operations, having rollback mechanisms is essential. Here’s an example:

```java
private void handleRollback() {
    try {
        bridge.triggerJSEvent("rollbackRequired", "{}");
    } catch (Exception e) {
        Logger.error(TAG, "Rollback failed", e);
    }
}
```
