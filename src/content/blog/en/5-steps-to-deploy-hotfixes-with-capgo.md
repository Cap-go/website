[Capgo](https://capgo.app/) makes deploying hotfixes fast and easy, skipping app store delays while keeping updates secure and compliant with Apple and Google guidelines. Here’s a quick overview of the process:

1.  **Create and Test Your Hotfix**: Write precise code changes, test thoroughly on devices, and ensure compatibility.
2.  **[Set Up Capgo](https://capgo.app/docs/webapp/)**: Install the [Capgo CLI](https://capgo.app/docs/cli/commands) with `npx @capgo/cli init`, configure encryption, and integrate with CI/CD tools.
3.  **Upload Your Hotfix**: Use the CLI to securely upload your update, label it clearly, and prepare for deployment.
4.  **Choose Update Settings**: Target specific users or groups, schedule rollouts, and define version requirements.
5.  **Track Your Update**: Monitor delivery rates, update speed, and user coverage. Roll back instantly if needed.

Capgo has delivered over 947.6 million updates globally and improved release efficiency by 81% for its users. It’s the go-to tool for agile teams needing quick, secure hotfix deployments.

## Step 1: Create and Test Your Hotfix

### Write the Hotfix Code

Focus on making precise changes that address the bug without compromising the app's stability.

Here’s a quick guide to structuring your hotfix:

| Best Practice | How to Apply It |
| --- | --- |
| **Isolated Changes** | Keep changes limited to the affected components. |
| **Version Control** | Use a dedicated branch for hotfix development. |
| **Documentation** | Include clear comments about the fix and its impact. |
| **Dependencies** | Ensure compatibility with existing app dependencies. |

With Capgo's instant update capability, you can zero in on fixing the bug without worrying about bundling unrelated changes. This method has proven effective, as highlighted by colenso:

> "We rolled out [Capgo OTA updates](https://web.capgo.app/resend_email) in production for our user base of +5000. We're seeing very smooth operation almost all our users are up to date within minutes of the OTA being deployed to @Capgo" [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

### Test on Your Device

Thorough testing is critical to ensure the hotfix works seamlessly. Use these steps:

-   **Development Testing:** Run the fix in your local development environment.
-   **Device Testing:** Check the fix on various devices and operating system versions.
-   **Integration Testing:** Confirm the fix doesn’t interfere with other features.

Automate as much of the testing process as possible using CI/CD tools.

Once your hotfix has passed all tests, you’re ready to set up Capgo for deployment.

## Step 2: Set Up [Capgo](https://capgo.app/)

### Install Required Packages

To get started with Capgo in your Capacitor project, use its CLI tool. Simply run the following command:

```bash
npx @capgo/cli init
```

This command does the heavy lifting for you:

-   Installs the [Capgo plugin](https://capgo.app/plugins/)
-   Configures your project automatically
-   Prepares your project for Capgo services

Once the installation is complete, you can move on to configuring your project with Capgo's encryption and compliance features.

### Set Up Your Project

Capgo ensures your project is ready with encryption and compliance standards for both Apple and Google. It works seamlessly with CI/CD tools, encrypts updates for security, and aligns with app store guidelines.

| Integration Step | Purpose | Benefit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CI/CD Setup** | Connects with CI/CD tools | Simplifies deployments |
| **E2E Encryption** | Secures update delivery | Maintains code integrity |
| **Platform Compliance** | Meets app store standards | Enables smooth distribution |

This setup has been validated by developers. As Bessie Cooper explains:

> "@Capgo is a must have tools for developers, who want to be more productive. Avoiding review for bugfix is golden." [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

For larger teams, Capgo offers features like multi-organization setups and detailed permission management. It integrates with platforms like [GitHub](https://github.com/about), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops), and [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), making automated deployment workflows straightforward. Rodrigo Mantica highlights its importance for agile teams:

> "We practice agile development and @Capgo is mission-critical in delivering continuously to our users!" [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

With your project fully set up, you're ready to upload your hotfix and deploy it instantly.

## Step 3: Upload Your Hotfix

### Send Files to Capgo

After setting up your project, it's time to upload your hotfix using the [Capgo CLI tool](https://capgo.app/docs/cli/commands/). This ensures a secure and efficient transfer of your update. Start by building your app as you normally would during development.

Here’s how it works:

-   Build your app using your standard process.
-   Double-check that all files compile without errors.
-   Use the Capgo CLI tool to upload your update.

### Label Your Updates

Clear labeling is key for managing and tracking your hotfixes. When uploading your update to Capgo, include specific version details and descriptive labels. This helps organize your updates and keeps everyone on the same page.

| **Labeling Element** | **Purpose** | **Best Practice** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Version Number | Tracks update sequence | Use semantic versioning |
| Update Description | Highlights key changes | Focus on main fixes and updates |
| Release Notes | Communicates changes | Detail specific improvements |

Martin Donadieu, Capgo's founder, has designed a versioning system that integrates smoothly with CI/CD workflows. This system makes it easy to track updates and roll back if necessary.

Capgo’s [update management](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/manual-update/) also includes features like end-to-end encryption and instant deployment, ensuring your hotfixes are secure while reaching users quickly.

Once your hotfix is uploaded and labeled, move on to Step 4 to configure your update settings.

## Step 4: Choose Update Settings

Once you've uploaded your hotfix, it's time to configure the settings for targeting users and defining rollout criteria. This ensures a controlled and effective deployment.

### Select Users and Devices

Capgo's user assignment tools let you pinpoint exactly who should receive the hotfix. There are two main strategies available:

| Deployment Type | Ideal For | Advantages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Private Testing** | Beta testers, QA teams | Enables controlled testing with early feedback |
| **Public Release** | All users, staged rollouts | Allows broad distribution with gradual deployment |

For example, if a bug affects users in a specific region, you can prioritize that group for quicker validation. After selecting your target audience, you can proceed to set detailed release rules.

### Set Release Rules

Through Capgo's web interface, you can fine-tune the release process by setting parameters like schedule, app version compatibility, and how gradually the update is rolled out.

Here are the key settings to configure:

-   **Deployment Schedule**: Choose specific times for the update to go live.
-   **Version Requirements**: Define which app versions should receive the update.
-   **Rollout Percentage**: Control the pace of the release, starting with a smaller group and expanding gradually.

For urgent fixes, you can opt for immediate deployment to address issues right away. For less critical updates, staged rollouts allow you to monitor performance and resolve potential problems as they arise. Additionally, Capgo provides options to create dedicated testing groups, making coordination smoother and more efficient.

## Step 5: Track Your Update

Keep an eye on your hotfix progress and tackle any issues as soon as they come up.

### Check Update Status

Capgo's analytics provide insights into key update metrics:

| Metric | What to Monitor | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Delivery Rate** | Percentage of successful updates | Shows how well your deployment is working |
| **Update Speed** | Time to reach target users | Highlights any slowdowns or bottlenecks |
| **User Coverage** | Number of devices updated | Indicates how many users received the fix |

### Handle Problems

After reviewing these metrics, be ready to address any challenges quickly.

-   **Rollback Instantly**  
    If something goes wrong, Capgo's rollback feature lets you instantly revert to the previous version.
    
-   **Analyze User Assignments**  
    Check how updates are distributed to spot if specific groups or devices are experiencing issues.
    
-   **Monitor Performance**  
    Use real-time metrics to pinpoint and resolve problems. Capgo's tools can help identify if the issue lies in delivery, installation, or compatibility.
