## Plugin Installation Commands

The Capacitor CLI makes adding plugins to your project straightforward and efficient. These commands handle the integration process, taking care of dependencies and ensuring compatibility with your setup.

### Basic Installation Commands

To add a Capacitor plugin to your project, use this simple command structure. For example, to install the Capgo plugin, run:

```bash
npx @capgo/cli init
```

This command takes care of the following:

-   Verifies that the plugin is compatible with your Capacitor version
-   Installs all required dependencies
-   Sets up platform-specific configurations
-   Updates your project's configuration files automatically

Stick to this process to avoid errors during installation.

### Installation Guidelines

Here’s how to ensure your plugin installs without issues:

**Pre-installation Steps**:

-   Make sure your Capacitor project is already set up
-   Navigate to the root directory of your project
-   Check that your [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version is current
-   Update to the latest version of the Capacitor CLI

**Handling Versions**:

-   Specify the plugin version you want during installation
-   Follow semantic versioning to avoid compatibility issues
-   Test the plugin in your development environment before deploying

> "Run npx @capgo/cli init that it!" - Capgo [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

After installation, confirm everything is set by reviewing your `package.json` and platform-specific configuration files. For any additional steps, consult the plugin's documentation.

## Plugin Update Commands

Keeping your Capacitor plugins up-to-date helps maintain app stability and ensures access to new features. The CLI offers tools to manage plugin updates efficiently.

### Finding Available Updates

Run these commands in your project's root directory:

```bash
npm outdated @capacitor/*
npx cap doctor
```

The `npx cap doctor` command checks your Capacitor setup, including plugin versions. It identifies issues and suggests updates to improve performance. Once you know which plugins need updates, use the commands below.

### Running Plugin Updates

To update plugins, use the following:

**Updating a Single Plugin**:

```bash
npm update @capacitor/plugin-name
npx cap sync
```

**Updating All Plugins at Once**:

```bash
npm update @capacitor/*
npx cap sync
```

If you're a Capgo user, their CLI tool simplifies the update process:

```bash
npx @capgo/cli update
```

### Managing Update Dependencies

After applying updates, follow these steps to manage dependencies effectively:

| Stage | Task | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pre-update | Review dependencies | Check current versions |
| During update | Resolve version conflicts | Fix incompatibilities |
| Post-update | Run platform-specific tests | Ensure everything works |

Capgo users benefit from advanced features like controlled rollouts. Their system has proven reliability:

-   95% of updates complete within 24 hours [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)
-   82% success rate globally for updates [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)
-   Compatibility with Capacitor 6 and 7 versions [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

To ensure smooth updates:

-   **Version Control**: Commit your changes before updating.
-   **Testing**: Apply updates in a development environment first.
-   **Dependency Warnings**: Address any peer dependency issues promptly.

Capgo also provides a rollback feature to reverse critical updates if problems arise [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

## Plugin Removal Commands

Removing plugins properly is crucial to avoid issues during updates and keep your development environment clean. Below, you'll find the steps for uninstalling plugins and verifying their complete removal.

### Uninstall Commands

To uninstall a Capacitor plugin, use the following command:

```bash
npm uninstall @capacitor/plugin-name
npx cap sync
```

For platform-specific updates, run:

```bash
npx cap update ios
npx cap update android
```

Need to remove multiple plugins at once? Use this:

```bash
npm uninstall @capacitor/plugin1 @capacitor/plugin2
npx cap sync
```

### Post-removal Cleanup

After uninstalling, follow these cleanup steps to ensure your project remains stable:

| Task | Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Update dependencies | `npm install` | Rebuilds the dependency tree |
| Sync platforms | `npx cap sync` | Updates native project configurations |

Additionally, manually remove leftover entries from **capacitor.config.ts**, **package.json**, and any platform-specific files.

### Confirming Plugin Removal

To confirm the plugin is completely removed, use these commands:

```bash
npm list @capacitor/*
npx cap doctor
```

-   **`npm list @capacitor/*`**: Checks for any remaining Capacitor-related dependencies.
-   **`npx cap doctor`**: Identifies orphaned dependencies, incomplete removals, or configuration issues.

Double-check these areas for residual traces:

-   **Project root**: Ensure the plugin is no longer listed in `package.json`.
-   **Native platforms**: Verify cleanup in iOS and Android directories.
-   **Build files**: Confirm the plugin is absent from compiled assets.

If you're using Capgo for plugin management, their CLI tool can help verify removal:

```bash
npx @capgo/cli verify
```

This command scans for any leftover traces that could cause conflicts, ensuring a thorough cleanup.

## Plugin Troubleshooting

If you're still facing issues after installing or updating plugins, here are some practical troubleshooting steps to help you identify and fix common problems.

When working with Capacitor plugins via CLI commands, developers often encounter challenges that can disrupt their workflow. Below is a guide to help you address these issues effectively.

### Diagnostic Tools

These commands can help you uncover problems with your CLI configuration:

```bash
npx cap doctor
npx cap sync --verbose
```

These tools can detect:

-   Missing dependencies
-   Version mismatches
-   Configuration errors specific to platforms
-   Plugin installation issues

For deeper insights, Capgo offers additional diagnostic commands:

```bash
npx @capgo/cli diagnose
npx @capgo/cli verify-plugins
```

After running diagnostics, use the table below to apply targeted fixes for specific errors.

### Common Error Fixes

Here are CLI commands to resolve frequent plugin issues:

| Error Type | Command | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Version Mismatch | `npx cap sync --force` | Forces plugins to synchronize |
| Platform Conflicts | `npx cap update <platform>` | Rebuilds platform-specific configurations |
| Dependency Issues | `npm cache clean --force` | Clears npm cache for fresh installations |
| Plugin Corruption | `npm rebuild` | Rebuilds plugin binaries |

For more stubborn update problems, try this sequence:

```bash
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npx cap sync
```

### CLI vs Manual Fixes

While CLI commands are often enough, some situations might require manual intervention.

**When to Use CLI:**

-   Routine plugin updates
-   Resolving dependency conflicts
-   Running diagnostics or syncing platform configurations

**When Manual Fixes Are Needed:**

-   Editing native platform code
-   Fixing merge conflicts
-   Customizing plugin settings
-   Migrating older plugins to newer versions

> "Cancelled my @Appflow subscription after 4 years. Code-Push never seemed to work well, hopefully @CapGO has it figured out" - LeVar Berry, @levarberry [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

Finally, always check platform-specific logs after running CLI commands:

-   **iOS**: Use [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)'s console for detailed logs
-   **Android**: Review logcat in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
-   **Web**: Inspect browser developer tools

If CLI commands don't solve the problem, check the plugin's GitHub repository for reported issues or community-provided solutions before attempting manual fixes.
