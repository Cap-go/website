## Step 1: Find Version Conflicts

Spotting version conflicts early can save you hours of debugging and prevent potential crashes. Here’s how you can identify these issues effectively.

### Check Versions with [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) CLI

![Capacitor](https://mars-images.imgix.net/seobot/screenshots/capacitorjs.com-4c1a6a7e452082d30f5bff9840b00b7d-2025-03-25.jpg?auto=compress)

The Capacitor CLI provides helpful commands to inspect your project's dependency versions. Open your terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run:

```bash
npx cap doctor
```

This command checks the health of your Capacitor setup and flags any version mismatches between:

-   Core Capacitor packages
-   Platform-specific dependencies
-   Installed plugins

For a more detailed breakdown of your setup, use:

```bash
npx cap ls
```

This will display:

-   Platforms you’ve installed (e.g., iOS, Android)
-   Plugin versions
-   Core package versions

While the CLI is a great starting point, error logs often provide additional clues about conflicts.

### Read Error Logs

Error logs can reveal hidden version conflicts. Here are some common error patterns and their causes:

| **Error Type** | **Description** | **Cause** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Build Error | `Incompatible plugin version` | Plugin version doesn’t match Capacitor core |
| Runtime Error | `Method not found` | Plugin uses outdated methods |
| Platform Error | `Gradle sync failed` | Conflicting Android dependencies |

When analyzing error logs, focus on:

-   **Stack traces**: These often point to specific plugins or dependencies causing issues.
-   **Version numbers**: Look for any version requirements mentioned in the logs.
-   **Platform-specific messages**: Pay close attention to errors tied to iOS or Android.

Some signs of version conflicts include:

-   Crashes during plugin operations
-   Features working on one platform but failing on another
-   Unexpected behavior after updates

**Pro tip**: Use verbose logging to get more detailed error information. Run these commands for deeper insights:

```bash
npx cap run android --verbose
npx cap run ios --verbose
```

Verbose logs can help you pinpoint the root cause of conflicts faster and with greater accuracy.

## Step 2: Check Project Dependencies

After identifying conflicts using the CLI and error logs, it's time to inspect your project's dependencies to avoid future problems.

### Review `package.json`

Your `package.json` file lists all your project's dependencies. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@capacitor/core": "5.5.1",
    "@capacitor/ios": "5.5.1",
    "@capacitor/android": "5.5.1",
    "@capacitor/camera": "5.0.7"
  }
}
```

Key things to check:

-   **Core dependencies**: Ensure `@capacitor/core`, `@capacitor/ios`, and `@capacitor/android` are on the same version.
-   **Plugin versions**: Verify that plugin versions are compatible with your Capacitor core version.
-   **Peer dependencies**: Look for any warnings about peer dependency conflicts.

To review your dependency tree, use this command:

```bash
npm ls @capacitor/*
```

### Use npm and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) Tools

![Yarn](https://mars-images.imgix.net/seobot/screenshots/yarnpkg.com-310d80dc5a96a440e9276d02217e08fa-2025-03-25.jpg?auto=compress)

Package managers like npm and Yarn offer helpful commands to detect and address dependency issues. Here's how they can assist:

| Command | Purpose | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npm outdated` | Lists outdated packages | Displays current and latest versions |
| `npm audit` | Checks for security vulnerabilities | Flags dependency risks |
| `yarn why package-name` | Explains why a package is installed | Shows dependency paths |

Run the following command for a full health check of your [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) environment and project dependencies:

```bash
npm doctor
```

**Key tips to consider:**

-   Always commit your lock files to version control.
-   Specify exact Capacitor versions (e.g., `5.5.1`) in your `package.json`.
-   Test updates thoroughly on both iOS and Android platforms.

For managing real-time updates and version control, you can use tools like Capgo.

Once your dependencies are in order, you can proceed to update Capacitor core components.

## Step 3: Update Capacitor Core

Keeping your Capacitor core components up to date ensures your app runs smoothly and avoids compatibility issues. This process helps resolve version conflicts and keeps everything working together seamlessly.

### Sync Platform Updates

To update Capacitor core components, use the following commands:

```bash
npm install @capacitor/core@latest
npm install @capacitor/cli@latest
npx cap sync
```

Running the `sync` command updates native files, aligns plugin dependencies, adjusts platform configurations, and regenerates native project files. Before syncing, back up your `ios` and `android` folders to avoid accidental data loss.

Consider using Capgo for live updates to keep versions consistent. Once the sync is complete, check for any API changes to address potential issues.

### Resolve Breaking Changes

Updating Capacitor core may introduce breaking changes. Follow these steps to handle them effectively:

1\. **Review API Changes**

Check the Capacitor changelog for any breaking changes. For example:

```typescript
// Old API (Capacitor 4)
Plugins.Camera.getPhoto()

// New API (Capacitor 5)
Camera.getPhoto()
```

Update your code to match the new APIs as needed.

2\. **Update Platform Configurations**

Review your `capacitor.config.json` file to ensure it's aligned with the updated core. For example:

```json
{
  "appId": "com.example.app",
  "appName": "MyApp",
  "webDir": "dist",
  "bundledWebRuntime": false,
  "plugins": {
    "SplashScreen": {
      "launchShowDuration": 3000
    }
  }
}
```

3\. **Verify Plugin Compatibility**

| Component | What to Do | How to Verify |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native Plugins | Update to match the new core version | Test native functionality |
| Custom Plugins | Check for interface changes | Run plugin-specific tests |
| Web Implementation | Update web-based plugin calls | Test in the browser |

**Pro Tip**: For major version updates (like moving from 4.x to 5.x), update one version at a time. This makes it easier to spot and fix issues.

Once you've completed these steps, thoroughly test your app to ensure all features are functioning correctly with the updated core.

## Step 4: Fix Plugin Version Issues

Plugin version conflicts can disrupt your Capacitor app's performance. Here's how to handle and resolve these issues effectively.

### Update Plugins

Keep your plugins aligned with the Capacitor core by running this command:

```bash
npx npm-check-updates "@capacitor/*" --target latest
```

For a full update of Capacitor plugins, use:

```bash
npm install @capacitor/core@latest @capacitor/cli@latest @capacitor/ios@latest @capacitor/android@latest
```

After updating, make sure to test native features to confirm compatibility.

| Update Type | Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single Plugin | `npm install @capacitor/plugin-name@version` | Update one plugin |
| All Plugins | `npx npm-check-updates "@capacitor/*" -u` | Update everything |
| Specific Version | `npm install @capacitor/plugin-name@x.x.x` | Lock to a specific version |

### Lock Plugin Versions

To avoid future conflicts, lock your plugin versions in `package.json`. This ensures consistent behavior across development and production environments.

Add a "resolutions" field to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "@capacitor/core": "5.0.0",
    "@capacitor/ios": "5.0.0",
    "@capacitor/android": "5.0.0"
  }
}
```

For Yarn users, enforce these resolutions with:

```bash
yarn install --force
```

## Step 5: Check Your Changes

After resolving version conflicts, it's crucial to test thoroughly to ensure your app remains stable and ready for updates across all environments.

### Local Testing

Start by running these commands to confirm everything is functioning as expected:

-   **Clean and reinstall dependencies:**

```bash
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

-   **Verify platform builds:**

```bash
npm run build
npx cap sync
```
