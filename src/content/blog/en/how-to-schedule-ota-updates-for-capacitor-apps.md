**Planning Update Schedules**

Once the tools are in place, the next step is deciding when and how updates will be rolled out.

### Timing Considerations

Scheduling OTA updates requires analyzing user behavior and technical factors. For example, releasing updates during off-peak hours - based on your users' global activity patterns - can help reduce interruptions during busy periods. Additionally, server capacity and network conditions should be factored in to ensure smooth delivery. These considerations play a key role in making updates run efficiently [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

### Update Schedule Guidelines

Using a phased rollout approach can make updates more manageable. Begin with a beta release to a small group of users, then gradually expand to the full user base. This method often relies on channel systems, allowing for controlled distribution. It also enables real-time monitoring and quick rollbacks if any issues arise.

> "We rolled out Capgo OTA updates in production for our user base of +5000. We're seeing very smooth operation almost all our users are upto date within minutes of the OTA being deployed to @Capgo." [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

## Update Management Steps

Successfully managing scheduled OTA updates requires careful code implementation, error handling, and thorough testing to ensure everything runs smoothly.

### Update Schedule Code

Here’s how you can set up [automatic background updates](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/self-hosted/auto-update/) with a simple script:

```typescript
import { CapacitorUpdater } from '@capgo/capacitor-updater'

async function scheduleUpdate() {
  try {
    // Check for updates
    const { bundle } = await CapacitorUpdater.download({
      version: 'latest'
    })

    // Schedule installation during off-peak hours
    await CapacitorUpdater.schedule({
      bundle,
      time: '03:00' // Schedule for 3 AM local time
    })
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Update scheduling failed:', error)
  }
}
```

This script integrates directly with your OTA setup, ensuring updates are timed effectively and deployed without disruptions.

### Error and Rollback Handling

Capgo offers built-in tools to handle errors and rollbacks, ensuring that any issues during updates are quickly resolved. If an update fails, the system can automatically revert to a stable version:

```typescript
async function handleFailedUpdate() {
  try {
    // Revert to last known stable version
    await CapacitorUpdater.rollback()

    // Log rollback event
    console.log('Update rolled back successfully')
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Rollback failed:', error)
  }
}
```

These features help maintain app stability by seamlessly restoring previous versions when needed. Always combine this with pre-release testing to minimize risks.

### Pre-release Testing

Once error-handling mechanisms are in place, testing becomes the next critical step. Capgo provides dedicated test channels for beta deployments, allowing you to:

-   Release updates to internal testers first
    
-   Gather performance data and feedback
    
-   Gradually expand to a larger audience

Capgo also supports user access control, making it easier to assign permissions and monitor specific groups during testing. Use the platform’s analytics to track performance and decide the best time for a full rollout [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

## Update Performance Tracking

Keeping an eye on OTA update performance helps refine your schedule and ensures smooth delivery.

### Update Metrics

Measuring key performance indicators (KPIs) is essential for assessing your [update strategy](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/hybrid-update). Recent data from Capgo's analytics platform highlights the following benchmarks for successful OTA updates:

| Metric | Target Benchmark | Industry Average |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 24-hour Adoption Rate | 95% of active users | 82% worldwide |
| Update Download Speed | Under 500ms | 434ms average |
| Bundle Download Time (5MB) | Under 150ms | 114ms via CDN |

You can integrate these metrics into your workflow with the following code snippet:

```typescript
import { CapacitorUpdater } from '@capgo/capacitor-updater'

async function trackUpdateMetrics() {
  const stats = await CapacitorUpdater.getUpdateStats({
    version: 'latest',
    timeframe: '24h'
  })

  console.log('Update adoption rate:', stats.activeUsers)
  console.log('Download success rate:', stats.successRate)
}
```

These KPIs provide a solid foundation for improving your update strategy.

### Schedule Optimization

Timing plays a big role in update success. Deployment data suggests these scheduling practices:

-   **Off-peak Hours**: Roll out updates between 1 AM and 4 AM local time.
    
-   **Gradual Rollout**: Begin with 10% of users and expand gradually over 24 hours.
    
-   **Geographic Distribution**: Spread updates across time zones for better coverage.
    

Key factors to monitor for schedule optimization include:

-   Completion time for updates
    
-   Network performance metrics
    
-   Regional error rates
    
-   User engagement after updates
    

Real-time analytics can help you quickly address any issues. Tools like error tracking ensure a 95% success rate within the first 24 hours of deployment [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).
