Securing your app's API is critical for meeting Apple App Store and Google Play requirements. This guide outlines **five key API security standards** to help you comply with platform rules, protect user data, and improve app performance.

### Key Takeaways:

-   **[OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/)**: Secure user authentication with token-based access.
-   **[OpenID Connect](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect)**: Add an identity layer for enhanced user verification.
-   **TLS/SSL**: [Encrypt data](https://capgo.app/docs/cli/migrations/encryption/) in transit to prevent tampering.
-   **JWT Security**: Safeguard tokens with proper signing and storage.
-   **API Rate Controls**: Protect APIs from abuse with request limits.

By implementing these standards, you’ll ensure your [Capacitor app](https://capgo.app/plugins/ivs-player/) meets approval criteria while keeping user data safe. Ready to dive deeper? Let’s break it down step by step.

## 1\. [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) Implementation

![OAuth 2.0](https://assets.seobotai.com/capgo.app/6809811c9bd9ce97f26b7b78/d1868b22bd285dedc49624e0c0ea2ab6.jpg)

OAuth 2.0 is a widely-used protocol for securely authorizing mobile apps. It allows third-party apps to access user resources without exposing sensitive credentials. Platforms like Apple and Google require secure, standards-compliant authentication, and OAuth 2.0 fulfills these requirements through token-based security and controlled API access.

Here’s how to set up OAuth 2.0 in your Capacitor app:

### Key Authorization Flows

-   **Authorization Code with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange):** The most secure flow, ideal for mobile apps.
-   **Implicit Flow:** Use only if required for older systems.
-   **Client Credentials:** For service-to-service communication.

### Steps for Integration

1.  **Token Management**
    
    -   Retrieve tokens securely.
    -   Store tokens in [encrypted storage](https://capgo.app/docs/cli/migrations/encryption/) to prevent unauthorized access.
    -   Automate token refresh to ensure uninterrupted access.
    -   Validate token signatures to confirm authenticity.
2.  **Security Measures**
    
    -   Limit access by configuring scopes.
    -   Set token expiration times to reduce risks.
    -   Apply rate limiting to prevent abuse.
    -   Monitor authentication attempts for suspicious activity.
3.  **App Store Compliance**
    
    -   Use OAuth providers approved by Apple.
    -   Meet Google Play's security guidelines.
    -   Clearly document your app’s authentication workflows.
    -   Keep audit logs for review and troubleshooting.

For added protection, consider layering OAuth 2.0 with other authentication methods. This approach not only safeguards sensitive user data but also helps secure API endpoints, ensuring compliance with platform requirements [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)\[2\].

## 2\. [OpenID Connect](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect) Setup

OpenID Connect builds on OAuth 2.0 by adding an identity layer to ensure secure user authentication.

### Key Implementation Steps

1.  **Identity Token Settings**
    
    -   Define scopes like `openid`, `profile`, and `email`.
    -   Set access token lifetimes between 15–30 minutes.
    -   Enable refresh token rotation for enhanced security.
2.  **User Authentication Process**
    
    -   Use native authentication via system browsers and device biometrics.
    -   Store tokens securely in encrypted storage.
    -   Always validate tokens on the server side.
3.  **Claims Management**
    
    -   Request only the user information you actually need.
    -   Implement proper session management to maintain security.

### Platform-Specific Guidelines

**For iOS:**

-   Use **ASWebAuthenticationSession** for secure authentication.
-   Support **Sign in with Apple** if required.
-   Store tokens securely using the keychain.
-   Enable certificate pinning for added protection.

**For Android:**

-   Use **Chrome Custom Tabs** for authentication flows.
-   Secure credentials with the Android keystore.
-   Integrate **Google Sign-In** where applicable.
-   Enable **[SafetyNet](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/safetynet/SafetyNetApi) attestation** for additional security.

### Security Best Practices

-   Implement logout processes to clear sessions effectively.
-   Use state parameters to guard against CSRF attacks.
-   Enable **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)** for secure connections.
-   Monitor authentication attempts to detect suspicious behavior.

Finally, ensure all authentication exchanges are protected in transit by enforcing TLS/SSL.

## 3\. TLS/SSL Security

TLS/SSL ensures your data stays encrypted while it's being transmitted. TLS (Transport Layer Security) protects API traffic, keeping it safe from eavesdropping or tampering.

### Key Security Practices

-   Use **TLS v1.2 or higher** for all API communications. This keeps OAuth tokens and OpenID identity assertions private between the client and server.
-   Apply **certificate pinning** for both iOS and Android applications.
-   Activate **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)** on your servers to enforce secure connections.

### Capacitor Setup

Set up Capacitor's HTTP plugin or WKWebView/NSSecureTransport to block invalid certificates. For live updates, tools like Capgo offer end-to-end encryption that meets both Apple and Google guidelines [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

## 4\. JWT Security Measures

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are essential for securing API communications, especially when ensuring compliance with app store requirements. They enhance your OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect setup by focusing on the security of the tokens themselves.

### Token Signing Guidelines

-   Use **asymmetric RS256 (RSA-SHA256)** for signing tokens, and rotate private keys every 90 days.
-   Store JWTs in **[encrypted secure storage](https://capgo.app/docs/cli/migrations/encryption/)** to prevent unauthorized access.
-   Validate key elements such as the **signature**, **issuer (iss)**, **audience (aud)**, and **expiration**.
-   Keep the payload minimal - include only necessary claims, add a unique identifier (_jti_), and avoid sensitive data.

### Managing Token Lifecycles

-   Refresh tokens **5 minutes before they expire** to ensure uninterrupted access.
-   Maintain a **revocation list** (e.g., using [Redis](https://redis.io/)) to immediately invalidate compromised tokens.

### Handling Errors

When errors occur, return **generic error messages** like `invalid_token` to avoid exposing validation details.

### App Store Compliance

For app store-specific requirements, make sure your JWT implementation:

-   Adheres to the platform's **keychain storage guidelines**.
-   Includes proper **audit logging** for all token-related operations.

## 5\. API Rate Controls

Managing how often users can access your API is just as important as securing it. Rate limits help prevent misuse, protect against DDoS attacks, and ensure resources are shared fairly among users.

### Rate Limiting Strategies

Once your tokens are secure, it's time to decide how many requests each client can make.

**Request Limits**

-   Restrict requests based on IP addresses
-   Set per-user quotas linked to API keys
-   Allow occasional bursts to handle traffic spikes

**Time-Based Limits**

-   _Fixed window_: Resets limits at regular intervals (e.g., every minute or hour)
-   _Sliding window_: Tracks usage over a rolling time period
-   _Token bucket_: Issues tokens for requests, replenished over time

### Implementation Guidelines

**Headers and Response Codes**

When enforcing limits, include helpful headers in your responses:

-   Use HTTP 429 ("Too Many Requests") when limits are exceeded
-   Add headers like `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset` to keep users informed
-   Include a `Retry-After` header to indicate when they can try again

### Monitoring and Alerts

Keep an eye on how your API is being used with these steps:

-   Monitor API usage in real time to spot patterns
-   Identify and block suspicious activity
-   Set up alerts for unusual traffic spikes
-   Log rate limit violations for future analysis

### Error Response Example

When a client exceeds the rate limit, respond with a clear JSON message. For example:

```json
{
  "error": "rate_limit_exceeded",
  "message": "Request quota exceeded",
  "retry_after": "<seconds until reset>"
}
```

### Rate-Limiting Storage

To enforce rate limits efficiently, use a distributed cache like Redis or [Memcached](https://memcached.org/). These systems help track request counts across multiple instances while maintaining high performance.

Next: App Store Security Rules.

## App Store Security Rules

Let’s dive into the network and storage security requirements enforced by Apple and Google. These rules go beyond just OAuth tokens and rate limits, ensuring your app meets platform standards.

### iOS Requirements

-   **App Transport Security (ATS)** must be enabled:
    -   TLS 1.2 or newer
    -   Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
    -   Certificates with at least SHA-256
-   Protect sensitive data using the Keychain.
-   Set up certificate pinning for secure communication.
-   Encrypt all local data.

### Android Requirements

-   Use **Network Security Config** to:
    -   Restrict clear-text traffic.
    -   Define certificate pinning rules.
    -   Specify custom certificate authorities if needed.
-   Encrypt files securely.
-   Configure SafetyNet attestation for device integrity checks.
-   Use the Android Keystore for secure key management.

### Common Platform Rules

Both platforms share several key security requirements:

-   Use HTTPS for all connections.
-   Validate certificates properly.
-   Ensure SSL/TLS settings are configured securely.
-   Protect local storage with encryption.
-   Keep detailed audit logs.
-   Provide documentation of your security measures.

## API Access Control Methods

Protecting your API endpoints goes beyond just securing platform transport and tokens. Fine-tuned access controls are key to ensuring your API remains secure.

### Key Access Control Methods

-   **API Key Validation**  
    Use cryptographically secure keys with set expiration dates. Automate key rotation every 90 days and enforce rate limits and usage quotas per key. Always log key usage for auditing purposes. This method works well alongside OAuth 2.0 for service-to-service calls.
    
-   **OAuth Scopes Enforcement**  
    Assign specific scopes to API permissions and validate them on every request. Reject any request missing proper authorization and clearly document scope requirements for app store reviews. Pairing scopes with JWT claims can help further restrict access.
    
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
    Define roles with precise permissions and assign them through your authentication system. Check role authorizations for every API call, and securely store role assignments in encrypted storage.
    
-   **Token Introspection & Revocation**  
    Perform real-time token validation and maintain a centralized blacklist for compromised tokens. Allow immediate revocation and set up monitoring to flag suspicious token activity.
    

### Platform Compliance

For approval on platforms like Apple's App Store or Google Play:

-   Clearly document your access control methods during security reviews.
-   Handle unauthorized requests with proper error responses.
-   Keep detailed access logs for audit purposes.
-   Enable real-time monitoring to quickly address security incidents.

These measures align with Apple's and Google's security guidelines, ensuring your API meets their standards.
