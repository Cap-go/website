**Apple's 2025 App Store policies bring stricter rules for [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) apps.** Developers must now meet higher standards for privacy, security, and performance. Here's what you need to know:

-   **Privacy**: Stricter rules for data collection and user consent.
-   **Security**: End-to-end encryption and [stronger authentication](https://capgo.app/docs/webapp/mfa/) are required for updates.
-   **Performance**: Apps must meet higher responsiveness and efficiency benchmarks.
-   **SDK Updates**: [Capacitor apps](https://capgo.app/blog/capacitor-comprehensive-guide/) must use [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) 15+ and updated SDKs to stay compliant.
-   **Live Updates**: Over-the-air (OTA) updates must follow encrypted protocols and thorough device testing.

**Key Tool**: Platforms like [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) simplify compliance by automating [update management](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/manual-update/), tracking, and encryption. With a 95% update rate within 24 hours and tools for secure rollouts, [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) helps developers stay aligned with Apple's policies.

**Quick Comparison**:

## Major Policy Updates for 2025

Apple's policies for 2025 require Capacitor apps to use updated versions of Xcode and SDKs. These updates are designed to improve performance, security, and compatibility with hardware.

Capacitor developers should carefully review Apple's guidelines to ensure they are using the recommended tools. Staying compliant not only avoids potential issues but also provides access to the latest features. These tool updates play a key role in shaping live update strategies.

Platforms like Capgo have already aligned with these requirements, making it easier to deliver updates while meeting Apple's new standards.

## Meeting Apple's Guidelines

Staying aligned with Apple's guidelines while implementing live updates requires careful attention to specific protocols. These rules are essential to ensure your app remains functional, secure, and compliant with Apple’s standards.

### OTA Update Rules

Over-the-air (OTA) updates must adhere to strict protocols to stay in line with App Store policies. Developers should use **end-to-end encryption** for all update transmissions to protect user data. Capgo’s implementation ensures these standards are met while delivering strong performance.

### Security Standards

Apple’s security requirements emphasize robust data protection. These measures are critical for enabling secure and efficient update cycles, ensuring updates are delivered safely without violating platform rules.

### Device Testing Protocol

To ensure updates work seamlessly across all iOS versions, thorough device testing is essential. Developers should take advantage of **staged rollouts** through beta testing channels. This approach helps identify and fix issues before a full release. As Bessie Cooper highlights:

> "Capgo is a must have tools for developers, who want to be more productive. Avoiding review for bugfix is golden." [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

This method allows for quick development and reliable updates while staying compliant with Apple's guidelines.

### Plugin Maintenance

Make sure to update your Capacitor framework to version 5.0 or later to meet Apple's updated SDK requirements. Staying compliant means regularly testing your apps with the latest iOS SDK and Xcode versions. If you're using Capgo's platform, the process is easier thanks to automated compatibility checks and instant deployment features. These tools work seamlessly with Capacitor 6 and 7. Developers also face similar challenges when transitioning PWAs into native apps.

### PWA to Native Migration

With Apple's updated policies, moving PWAs to native apps now requires following stricter privacy and data handling rules. It's best to evaluate your app's functionality and migrate in stages to ensure everything stays compliant. Capgo supports this process by offering instant fixes and fast updates during the migration.
