## Firebase Setup Guide

Setting up Firebase Performance Monitoring in your [Capacitor app](https://capgo.app/plugins/ivs-player/) requires a few clear steps to ensure accurate data tracking.

### Install Firebase SDK

Start by adding the Firebase SDK to your project and configuring it for your platform(s):

-   **Install Firebase Dependencies**

Run the following commands to install the necessary Firebase packages:

```bash
npm install @capacitor-firebase/performance
npm install firebase
```

-   **Initialize Firebase**

Set up Firebase in your main application file:

```typescript
import { FirebasePerformance } from '@capacitor-firebase/performance';
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';

const firebaseConfig = {
  // Add your Firebase configuration object here
};

initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
await FirebasePerformance.initializePerformance();
```

-   **Add Platform Configurations**

Update your `capacitor.config.json` file to enable performance monitoring:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "FirebasePerformance": {
      "collectMetrics": true,
      "instrumentationEnabled": true,
      "dataCollectionEnabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Set Up Performance Tracking

You can start tracking specific app activities like database queries or network requests using Firebase Performance Monitoring.

-   **Track Database Queries**

```typescript
async function trackDatabaseQuery() {
  const trace = await FirebasePerformance.startTrace({ traceName: 'database_query' });

  // Perform your database operation
  await performDatabaseOperation();

  await FirebasePerformance.stopTrace({ traceName: 'database_query' });
}
```

-   **Monitor Network Requests**

```typescript
await FirebasePerformance.setAttributes({
  traceName: 'api_call',
  attributes: {
    endpoint: '/users',
    method: 'GET'
  }
});
```

-   **Track Custom Metrics**

For custom metrics, such as tracking the value of a shopping cart:

```typescript
await FirebasePerformance.putMetric({
  traceName: 'checkout_flow',
  metricName: 'cart_value',
  value: 99.99
});
```

Once these traces are implemented, you can review the collected data in the Firebase Console.

### Use Firebase Console

After setting up monitoring, you can view and analyze your app's performance data in the Firebase Console:

1.  **Access Performance Data**
    
    -   Log in to Firebase Console.
    -   Select your project.
    -   Navigate to **Performance Monitoring**.
    -   Choose your app from the dropdown menu.
2.  **Monitor Key Metrics**
    

The dashboard provides insights into various performance indicators, including:

-   App start time
-   Success rate of network requests
-   Screen render time
-   Results from custom traces

3.  **Set Up Custom Reports**

Create tailored reports to analyze specific aspects of your app's performance, such as:

-   Performance differences by location
-   Metrics based on device type
-   Effects of network conditions
-   Patterns in custom traces

Use these tools to identify and address performance bottlenecks effectively.

## [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) Error Tracking Setup

![Sentry](https://mars-images.imgix.net/seobot/screenshots/sentry.io-925fc70e12ac801815ba3ab27e6adcda-2025-03-23.jpg?auto=compress)

Firebase handles performance metrics, but Sentry is all about catching and diagnosing errors. Together, they give you a strong monitoring setup.

### Install Sentry SDK

Start by installing the required Sentry packages:

```bash
npm install @sentry/capacitor
# Add the Sentry package for your specific framework
```

Once installed, set up Sentry in your app's entry point.

### Initialize Sentry

Configure Sentry in your app's entry point using the following setup:

```typescript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/capacitor";
import { BrowserTracing } from "@sentry/browser";

Sentry.init({
    dsn: "your-project-dsn",
    integrations: [new BrowserTracing()],
    tracesSampleRate: 0.2,
    environment: "production",
    release: "app-version@" + process.env.VERSION,
    dist: process.env.BUILD_NUMBER,
    debug: false
});
```

This configuration includes release tracking, which links errors to specific app versions.

### Configure Error Tracking

You can tailor error tracking further by using custom error boundaries and try-catch blocks.

**Custom Error Boundaries:**

```typescript
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
    componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
        Sentry.captureException(error, { extra: errorInfo });
    }
}
```

**Tracking Specific Errors:**

```typescript
try {
    riskyOperation();
} catch (error) {
    Sentry.captureException(error, {
        tags: { operation: "data_sync", severity: "critical" },
        extra: { userId: currentUser.id, timestamp: new Date().toISOString() }
    });
}
```

**Monitoring Performance:**

```typescript
const transaction = Sentry.startTransaction({
    name: "API Request",
    op: "http.request"
});

try {
    await makeApiCall();
} finally {
    transaction.finish();
}
```

These methods ensure your app logs errors effectively, making them easier to track and resolve via Sentry.

### Use Sentry Dashboard

The Sentry dashboard provides tools to dig into errors and understand them better:

-   **Real-time monitoring**: Check error frequency, resolution status, and the users affected.
-   **Error analysis**: Review stack traces, group similar errors, and filter by environment.
-   **Alerts**: Set error thresholds, configure notification options, and create custom alert rules.

This dashboard makes diagnosing and fixing issues straightforward.

## Monitoring Best Practices

### Focus on Key Metrics

Capgo's analysis of 750 production apps [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/) highlights key metrics to monitor:

-   **Update Success Rate**: Aim for at least 82%.
-   **Update Speed**: Global CDN should deliver 5 MB in 114 ms.
-   **User Adoption**: 95% of users should update within 24 hours.
-   **API Response Time**: Keep it under 500 ms (global average is 434 ms).

Set up alerts to quickly detect any deviations in these metrics.

### Create Effective Alert Rules

Here's an example of how to configure alerts for performance monitoring:

```typescript
// Example alert configuration
{
    performance: {
        apiLatency: {
            threshold: 1000, // ms
            period: "5m",
            condition: "above"
        },
        errorRate: {
            threshold: 1.0, // percentage
            period: "15m",
            condition: "above"
        },
        updateSuccess: {
            threshold: 75, // percentage
            period: "1h",
            condition: "below"
        }
    }
}
```

### Keep Monitoring and Adjusting

Once your alerts are in place, focus on continuous monitoring and refinement:

-   **Regular Performance Checks**: Review update success rates by region, analyze error trends for different app versions, and monitor API response times during peak hours.
    
-   **Staged Rollouts for Updates**: Begin with 10% of users for the first 24 hours. If everything runs smoothly, increase to 50% and finalize the rollout after 48 hours of stable performance.
    
-   **Ongoing Optimization**: Investigate failed updates, identify slow-performing API endpoints, and evaluate user engagement following updates to ensure sustained improvements.
