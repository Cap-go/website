## OTA Update Debugging Basics

### Platform Requirements

[Capacitor OTA updates](https://capgo.app/ja/) need proper native integration to work smoothly. For iOS, this means strict code signing and update validation. On Android, managing version codes and ensuring compatibility is crucial to avoid update issues.

Key platform checks include:

-   Keeping native dependencies up-to-date
-   Verifying plugin compatibility
-   Using separate build configurations for iOS and Android

Once these are in place, it's time to explore OTA distribution options.

### Update Distribution Methods

[Capacitor apps](https://capgo.app/blog/capacitor-comprehensive-guide/) support multiple OTA update methods. Tools like Capgo ensure compliance with both Apple and Android guidelines.

| Distribution Method | Key Features | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Manual Updates](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/manual-update/) | Full control over the update process, supports custom URLs | Smaller apps, testing |
| Capgo | Offers end-to-end encryption, CI/CD integration, and user assignment | Enterprise applications |
| @capawesome/capacitor-live-update | Manages versions and provides basic update functionality | Simple apps |

Choose the method that best fits your app's needs and workflow.

### Development Setup

Setting up your environment involves using [Capacitor CLI commands](https://capgo.app/docs/cli/commands/) and configuring settings correctly.

Important setup steps:

-   Run `npx cap sync` to sync dependencies
-   Adjust native settings in the _capacitor.config.json_ file
-   Test updates locally to ensure everything works

For iOS app inspection, Inspect.dev offers tools compatible with Windows and Chrome DevTools. It costs $49/year after a 14-day free trial.

Keep version control organized to track changes and simplify debugging. Use Capacitor CLI commands to test updates across platforms efficiently.
