## 10 Core PIPEDA Rules for Apps

These ten rules outline essential steps for app developers to comply with PIPEDA and protect user data.

### Data Protection Responsibilities

App developers must put in place strong data protection measures to meet PIPEDA's accountability requirements. Key steps include:

-   Assigning a dedicated privacy officer
-   Keeping detailed records of data inventories
-   Performing privacy impact assessments
-   Creating clear protocols for responding to data breaches

Organizations should document how they handle data and be ready to show compliance if needed. Sensitive data access should also be tracked through audit logs.

These measures are crucial for managing user consent, which is covered in the next section.

### User Permission Requirements

Under PIPEDA, apps must secure clear and informed consent before collecting personal data. Here's what that involves:

-   **Clear Purpose**: Clearly explain why data is being collected.
-   **Granular Controls**: Allow users to opt in or out of specific data types.
-   **Timing**: Obtain consent before or at the time of data collection.
-   **Plain Language**: Use simple, easy-to-understand terms.
-   **Essential Information**: Make key privacy details readily available.
-   **Detailed Explanations**: Provide additional privacy information through resources like FAQs or [privacy policies](https://capgo.app/dp/).

For sensitive data, such as health or financial details, explicit consent is mandatory.

### Security and Data Quality Standards

Strong security and data quality practices are a must to protect user information. Below is a breakdown of key requirements:

| Security Requirement | Implementation Example |
| --- | --- |
| [Data Encryption](https://capgo.app/docs/cli/migrations/encryption/) | Use end-to-end encryption for data transfers |
| Access Controls | Apply [multi-factor authentication](https://capgo.app/docs/webapp/mfa/) for admin access |
| Regular Updates | Release timely security patches and conduct vulnerability checks |
| Data Accuracy | Provide tools for users to review and update their information |
| Breach Detection | Implement real-time monitoring and alert systems |

When dealing with sensitive data like location or financial information, apps should use top-tier encryption and secure storage methods. If third-party services are involved, ensure they follow the same security standards, backed by regular audits, data quality reviews, and secure data deletion processes.

## PIPEDA Compliance Checklist

### Privacy Risk Assessment Steps

Start with a privacy risk assessment to identify potential weaknesses in how data is handled:
