## Standard App Store Updates

The app store update process is a cornerstone of mobile app distribution, but it often clashes with the fast-paced demands of agile development. While dependable, it can slow down workflows that require rapid deployment.

### App Store Update Process

Submitting updates to an app store involves a series of steps that can stretch development timelines. Developers need to:

-   Package a new app version with an updated version number
-   Submit the app for review through the app store's platform
-   Wait for approval before the update becomes available to users
-   Track adoption and performance after release

The review process typically takes 24-72 hours, but more complex updates can take even longer. For teams following agile practices, this delay can pose serious challenges, especially when urgent bug fixes are required.

### Pros and Cons of App Store Updates

App store updates come with clear benefits but also present obstacles that can affect both development and user experience:

| Aspect | Benefits | Limitations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Quality Control** | Ensures security and compliance | Delays deployment |

| **Bug Fixes** | Allows thorough testing | Slows down critical fixes |

These limitations become especially apparent in scenarios where:

-   Critical bugs require immediate attention
-   Security threats need to be patched quickly
-   New features must align with marketing timelines
-   A/B testing demands rapid iterations

Because of these challenges, many teams have started exploring alternative approaches that work alongside traditional app store updates. These solutions aim to provide greater flexibility for specific types of updates.

Next, we’ll dive into how Capacitor OTA updates can address these challenges by enabling faster fixes and more agile iteration.

## [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) OTA Updates Explained

![Capacitor](https://mars-images.imgix.net/seobot/screenshots/capacitorjs.com-4c1a6a7e452082d30f5bff9840b00b7d-2025-03-08.jpg?auto=compress)

Over-the-air (OTA) updates have transformed how mobile apps are maintained and updated. For [Capacitor apps](https://capgo.app/blog/capacitor-comprehensive-guide/), this method allows developers to deliver changes directly to users without waiting for app store reviews.

### Key Components

In Capacitor apps, OTA updates focus on updating web assets like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which control the app’s functionality. Once a developer pushes an update, users automatically receive the changes the next time they open the app - no manual downloads required.

Here’s how it works:

| Component | Function |
| --- | --- |
| Version Control | Manages and tracks different versions of web assets |
| Update Detection | Identifies new versions when the app starts |
| File Download | Securely downloads updated files in the background |
| Live Deployment | Applies updates instantly on the next app launch |

### Why OTA Updates Stand Out

OTA updates bring clear advantages compared to traditional app store updates:

| Aspect | Traditional Updates | OTA Updates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deployment Speed | 24–72 hours | Minutes |
| User Adoption | Requires manual download | Automatic |
| Bug Fix Timeline | Weeks | Immediate fixes |
| Release Frequency | Monthly or quarterly | Multiple times per week |
| Development Agility | Limited by review process | Instant iteration |

Capgo takes these benefits further by offering a streamlined platform that ensures security and integrates effortlessly with CI/CD workflows.
