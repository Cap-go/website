OTA (Over-the-Air) updates allow [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) apps to update content like JavaScript, CSS, and HTML without requiring app store submissions. While convenient, these updates can impact app startup performance. Here's a quick guide to optimize OTA updates for better performance and user experience:

-   **Minimize Update File Size**: Use techniques like differential updates, compression (e.g., [ZSTD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zstd)), and eliminating unnecessary file changes.
    
-   **Efficient Code Loading**: Prioritize loading core features first, delay non-critical components, and use lazy loading for heavy modules.
    
-   **Incremental Updates**: Break updates into smaller steps, schedule them during idle times, and use A/B systems for seamless rollbacks.
    
-   [**Secure Updates**](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/hybrid-update/): Protect files with encryption, checksums, and code signing to ensure integrity.
    
-   **Testing & Compliance**: Test updates thoroughly and follow app store guidelines to avoid approval issues.

## Performance Tips for OTA Updates

These strategies tackle startup delays and ensure smoother OTA update processes by focusing on file size reduction and efficient code loading.

### Reducing Update File Size

Keeping update file sizes small is essential for quicker downloads and faster startups. The idea is to transfer less data without sacrificing functionality. Here's how you can achieve this:

-   Create a `live-update-manifest.json` to enable differential updates.
    
-   Use **ZSTD compression** for non-A/B devices to shrink full image updates.
    
-   Eliminate build timestamps and standardize build tools to avoid unnecessary file changes.
    
-   For A/B OTA updates, apply Puffin recompression to generate patches more efficiently.
    

### Managing Code Loading

Startup speed isn't just about file size - when code loads also matters. Here's a smart approach to manage code loading:

-   **Core Features First**: Load essential functions like authentication and main navigation immediately.
    
-   **Secondary Features Later**: Delay loading for non-critical components like advanced settings, analytics, and animations.
    
-   **Efficient Resource Use**: Apply progressive or lazy loading for heavy modules and media after the app has launched.
    

### Step-by-Step Updates

Breaking updates into smaller steps reduces disruptions during startup. Incremental updates are a practical way to ensure a seamless experience. For example, Android 8.0 uses streaming updates that require only about 100 KiB of metadata storage instead of downloading the entire package [\[3\]](https://source.android.com/docs/core/ota/ab).

-   Schedule updates during idle times, such as overnight, and prioritize Wi-Fi connections.
    
-   Protect update files with encryption and checksum verification [\[1\]](https://www.trio.so/blog/over-the-air-update/)[\[2\]](https://mender.io/blog/how-does-an-ota-firmware-update-work).
    
-   Use A/B partition systems to allow updates without interrupting app functionality [\[3\]](https://source.android.com/docs/core/ota/ab).
    

Capgo provides built-in tools for secure, incremental updates, featuring end-to-end encryption and flexible deployment options.

## Setting Up OTA Updates in [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/)

![Capacitor](https://mars-images.imgix.net/seobot/screenshots/capacitorjs.com-4c1a6a7e452082d30f5bff9840b00b7d-2025-02-22.jpg?auto=compress)

Setting up Over-the-Air (OTA) updates in Capacitor requires careful testing and adherence to strict guidelines.

### Pre-Release Testing

Before rolling out updates, thorough testing is essential:

-   Use testing environments that closely replicate production settings.
    
-   Record baseline metrics like startup time, memory usage, bandwidth, and battery consumption.
    
-   Verify fallback mechanisms to ensure the server path resets if an update fails [\[4\]](https://capgo.app/blog/how-live-updates-for-capacitor-work/).
    

Once performance is stable, check that the updates meet app store regulations.

### App Store Rules

To avoid issues with app store approvals, follow these platform-specific rules:

**Apple App Store Requirements:**

> "Interpreted code may be downloaded to an Application but only so long as such code: (a) does not change the primary purpose of the Application by providing features or functionality that are inconsistent with the intended and advertised purpose of the Application as submitted to the App Store, (b) does not create a store or storefront for other code or applications, and (c) does not bypass signing, sandbox, or other security features of the OS." [\[4\]](https://capgo.app/blog/how-live-updates-for-capacitor-work/)

**Google Play Store Guidelines:**

> "This restriction does not apply to code that runs in a virtual machine or an interpreter where either provides indirect access to Android APIs (such as JavaScript in a webview or browser)." [\[4\]](https://capgo.app/blog/how-live-updates-for-capacitor-work/)

### Using [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) for Updates
