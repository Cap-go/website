Over-The-Air (OTA) updates let you deliver app fixes and features directly to users without waiting for app store approvals. Using [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) CLI and tools like [Capgo](https://capgo.app/), you can push updates instantly, track performance, and even roll back if needed. Here's what you need to know:

### Key Benefits of OTA Updates:

-   **Instant Deployment**: Push updates immediately without app store delays.
-   **[Automatic Updates](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/auto-update/)**: Users get updates in the background.
-   **Version Management**: Easily manage and roll back versions.
-   **Selective Distribution**: Target specific user groups like beta testers.

### Requirements:

-   **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)** (v14.0+), **Capacitor CLI** (v6.0+ or 7.0+), **[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)**, and **[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)** (for iOS).

### Steps to Get Started:

1.  **Install [Capgo Plugin](https://capgo.app/plugins/)**: Run `npx @capgo/cli init` in your project.
2.  **Configure Platforms**:
    -   For Android: Enable native builds and update Gradle.
    -   For iOS: Adjust Xcode settings and enable background updates.
3.  **Deploy Updates**: Use Capgo's tools for fast and secure deployment.
4.  **Test Updates**: Use channel-based testing and analytics to monitor success rates.

### Tool Comparison:

## Setup Requirements

Get your environment ready with the necessary tools and configurations.

### Required Software

Make sure to install these tools:

| Software | Version | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Node.js** | 14.0+ | JavaScript runtime environment |
| **Capacitor CLI** | 6.0+ or 7.0+ | [Core framework for Capacitor app development](https://capgo.app/blog/) |
| **Android Studio** | Latest | Android app development |
| **Xcode** | 14.0+ | iOS app development (Mac only) |

### Initial Project Setup

Start by adding the Capgo plugin for OTA updates. Run the following command:

```bash
npx @capgo/cli init
```

After that, set up your Android and iOS environments to support OTA updates.

### Android and iOS Setup

Follow these steps to configure platform-specific settings:

**For Android:**

-   Enable native builds in your project settings.
-   Update Gradle configurations to support OTA updates.
-   Set up signing configurations.

**For iOS:**

-   Update your Xcode project settings.
-   Configure provisioning profiles.
-   Enable background update capabilities.

> "We rolled out Capgo OTA updates in production for our user base of +5000. We're seeing very smooth operation almost all our users are up to date within minutes of the OTA being deployed to @Capgo." - colenso [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

These steps ensure your project is compatible with Capacitor v6/v7 and ready for seamless OTA updates.

## OTA Update Implementation Steps

Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing Over-The-Air (OTA) updates using Capacitor CLI.

### Setting Up Capacitor CLI

Before you begin, make sure your project is compatible with Capacitor 6 or 7.

### Adding OTA Updates

Once your environment is ready, configure your OTA update settings. Capgo simplifies the process of managing updates across various environments:

| Environment | Purpose | Configuration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Development | Testing updates | Debug mode enabled |
| Staging | Beta testing | Channel-based distribution |
| Production | Live deployment | Staged rollout support |

### Update Deployment

Build and distribute updates using Capgo's automated commands for a smooth deployment process.

### Update Testing

After deploying, ensure the update functions as intended by performing targeted testing.

-   **Channel-Based Testing**  
    Set up separate channels for different user groups. This allows you to test updates systematically, monitor real-time performance, and gather insights on user engagement across versions.
    
-   **Analytics Monitoring**  
    Use Capgo's analytics dashboard to track update performance. According to Capgo, updates achieve an 82% success rate globally [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).
    

### Managing Failed Updates

To maintain app stability, implement error handling and rollback measures. Capgo provides tools like real-time error tracking, automatic rollback, and version control to address update failures efficiently.

## OTA Update Guidelines

### Update Security

Protect OTA updates by using **end-to-end encryption** [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/). Key steps include:

-   Using strong encryption protocols like Capgo's live update encryption.
-   Verifying digital signatures to ensure updates are legitimate [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

These practices help meet both App Store requirements and version control standards.

### App Store Rules

Apple App Store and Google Play Store have strict requirements for OTA updates. Make sure your updates align with platform guidelines, such as restrictions on altering binaries or core app functions, while adhering to their security standards.

Understanding these rules is essential for ensuring compliance and maintaining a [smooth update process](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/hybrid-update/).

### Version Management

Keep your app stable by managing versions effectively. Use separate channels for development, staging, and production. Include rollback mechanisms and track metrics like success rates, installation times, and error occurrences [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/). This approach ensures thorough testing and seamless transitions during deployment.

## OTA Tools Overview

Building on our OTA update guidelines, here's a look at the tools available for handling these updates effectively.

OTA update tools for Capacitor apps now come with a range of features and performance levels.

### Tool Comparison

Here’s a breakdown of the top OTA update tools for Capacitor apps:
