    -   [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) 8.0+

### Plugin Installation Steps

Once your environment is ready, follow these steps to install and configure the Capgo plugin:

1.  **Install the Capgo plugin:**
    
    Run the following command in your project directory:
    
    ```bash
    npm install @capgo/capacitor-updater
    ```
    
2.  **Set up your API key:**
    
    Initialize the plugin and configure your API key with:
    
    ```bash
    npx @capgo/cli init
    ```
    
3.  **Verify the [plugin installation](https://capgo.app/docs/getting-started/):**
    
    Check if the plugin is properly installed by running:
    
    ```bash
    npm list @capgo/capacitor-updater
    ```
    

### Project Sync

After installing the plugin, synchronize your project with the native platforms. This step ensures everything is aligned and up to date. The sync process includes:

| **Task** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- |
| Web Asset Transfer | Updates native platforms with the latest web assets |
| Config Updates | Adjusts platform-specific configuration files |
| Dependency Installation | Installs all required native dependencies |

To perform the sync, execute the following command:

```bash
npx cap sync
```

## Custom Event Setup

The Capgo plugin offers a reliable way to track custom events, helping you monitor user actions and app performance effectively.

### Event Structure

Every event you track is made up of two main parts:

| Component | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Event Name** | A short, descriptive identifier (max 40 characters) | `user_subscription_started` |
| **Event Parameters** | Key-value pairs providing additional context | `{plan_type: "solo", price: 12}` |

**Tips for naming your events:**

-   Always start with a letter.
-   Use `snake_case` and maintain case sensitivity.
-   Keep names short but meaningful.
-   Avoid using reserved keywords.

Once you've defined your event format, you can start logging events using the methods below.

### Event Logging Methods

To track events, use the `logEvent` method. Here's how to log basic events and transactions:

```typescript
await CapacitorUpdater.logEvent({
  name: "feature_accessed",
  data: {
    feature_name: "live_updates",
    access_time: Date.now()
  }
});

await CapacitorUpdater.logEvent({
  name: "purchase_completed",
  data: {
    plan: "MAKER",
    amount: 33.00,
    currency: "USD",
    subscription_period: "annual"
  }
});
```

### Screen Tracking

You can also track screen views to gain insights into how users navigate through your app:

```typescript
await CapacitorUpdater.logScreenView({
  screen_name: "settings_page",
  screen_class: "SettingsComponent",
  parameters: {
    source: "main_menu",
    user_type: "admin"
  }
});
```

**Best practices for screen tracking:**

-   Stick to consistent naming conventions across platforms.
-   Add relevant context parameters for better insights.
-   Track both entry and exit times for screens.
-   Use this data to analyze user navigation patterns effectively.

## Monitoring and Testing

Capgo offers tools to monitor custom events and troubleshoot implementation issues in real-time, making it easier to ensure your app runs smoothly.

### Debug Tools

Keep track of your event streams with these debugging options:

**Using the [Capgo CLI Debug Command](https://capgo.app/docs/cli/commands):**

```bash
npx @capgo/cli@latest app debug
```

This command gives you a live view of your event tracking, showing event names, parameters, and transmission status as they happen.

For more advanced debugging, you can rely on platform-specific tools:

| Platform | Debug Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iOS | Xcode + LLDB | Inspect native code, analyze memory usage |
| Android | Android Studio + Logcat | Log events in real-time, profile performance |
| Web | Chrome DevTools/Safari Inspector | Debug JavaScript, monitor network requests |

If you need even more detailed logs, you can enable verbose logging with this command:

```bash
npx cap run ios --verbose
```

Once you've confirmed your event flow is working as expected, it’s time to fine-tune data transfer settings for better performance.

### Data Transfer Settings

After verifying your events using [debugging tools](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/debugging/), you can optimize data transfer settings to ensure smooth and efficient performance. For example, Capgo’s CDN can transfer a 5MB bundle in just 114ms, with an API response time of 434ms.

**Security Configuration Example:**

```typescript
await CapacitorUpdater.configure({
  encryption: true,
  compressionLevel: "high",
  retryAttempts: 3,
  batchSize: 50
});
```

For apps handling a high volume of data, consider these best practices:

-   Use batch processing to minimize overhead.
-   Implement retry logic with exponential backoff to handle network issues.
-   Apply compression to reduce the size of large payloads.

To keep your data secure while maintaining speed, Capgo includes built-in validation checks and encryption protocols. These features ensure your event tracking remains both reliable and efficient.

## Advanced Configuration

### User Properties

With the Capgo plugin, you can set up persistent user properties to monitor user behavior effectively across sessions. Here's an example:

```typescript
await CapgoPlugin.setUserProperties({
  subscriptionTier: "premium",
  deviceType: "mobile",
  region: "US-West",
  lastLoginDate: new Date().toISOString()
});
```

For enterprise-level apps, you might want to include additional role-based details, such as user roles and permissions, to refine user segmentation. Once configured, ensure sensitive user data is protected by implementing strong privacy measures.

### Data Privacy Settings

Privacy compliance is critical, especially with regulations like GDPR and CCPA. The Capgo plugin simplifies this with built-in privacy controls:

```typescript
await CapgoPlugin.configurePrivacy({
  dataRetention: 90, // Days to retain event data
  piiEncryption: true,
  gdprCompliance: true,
  dataMinimization: true
});
```

**Best practices for privacy management**:

| Privacy Feature | Implementation | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data Encryption | End-to-end encryption | Keeps data secure during transfer and storage |
| User Consent | Opt-in mechanisms | Aligns with legal privacy requirements |
| Data Retention | 90-day default policy | Reduces storage of unnecessary data |
| Access Control | Role-based permissions | Limits access to sensitive information |

### Performance Settings

Once privacy is secured, it's time to fine-tune performance for efficient tracking. Use the following configuration to optimize resource usage:

```typescript
await CapgoPlugin.configurePerformance({
  batchSize: 50,
  batchInterval: 30000, // milliseconds
  retryStrategy: {
    maxAttempts: 3,
    backoffMultiplier: 1.5
  },
  compressionThreshold: 1024 // bytes
});
```

For environments with unreliable network connections, adaptive batching can help:

```typescript
await CapgoPlugin.setNetworkPolicy({
  lowBandwidthMode: true,
  maxPayloadSize: 100000, // bytes
  priorityEvents: ["purchase", "error", "crash"]
});
```

These settings ensure a balance between real-time tracking and efficient resource management, even under challenging network conditions.

### How can I troubleshoot and resolve issues with custom event tracking using Capgo tools?

To address custom event tracking issues in your Capacitor app, several tools and strategies from Capgo can come in handy. Start by using [web debugging tools](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/debugging/) like **Chrome DevTools** or **Safari Web Inspector**. These are great for inspecting API calls, tracking resource loading, and identifying JavaScript errors. For native components, rely on platform-specific tools such as **Xcode** for iOS or **Android Studio** for Android to dig deeper into potential problems.

Running key [Capacitor CLI commands](https://capgo.app/docs/cli/commands/) is another effective approach. For example, `npx cap doctor` helps diagnose configuration issues, while `npx cap sync` ensures plugins are correctly integrated into your project.

For a more robust [debugging process](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/debugging/), you might also integrate error tracking platforms like **Sentry** or **[LogRocket](https://logrocket.com/)**. These tools monitor real-time errors and user interactions, making them especially useful during over-the-air (OTA) updates. By combining these methods, you can streamline the debugging process and improve the performance of your custom event tracking.
