## Version Control Guidelines for [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/)

![Capacitor](https://mars-images.imgix.net/seobot/screenshots/capacitorjs.com-4c1a6a7e452082d30f5bff9840b00b7d-2025-02-26.jpg?auto=compress)

Managing Capacitor OTA updates requires a clear version control strategy. Here's how to keep things stable and ensure updates run smoothly.

### Semantic Versioning Basics

Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is a widely-used method for version numbering, structured as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. Each part has a specific role:

| **Version Component** | **Purpose** | **When to Update** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MAJOR (X)** | Signals breaking changes | When introducing API incompatibility |
| **MINOR (Y)** | Adds new features | When adding backward-compatible functionality |
| **PATCH (Z)** | Fixes bugs | When implementing backward-compatible fixes |

Apple's guidelines for downloaded code are worth noting:

> "Interpreted code may be downloaded to an Application, but only so long as such code: (a) does not change the primary purpose of the Application by providing features or functionality that are inconsistent with the intended and advertised purpose of the Application as submitted to the App Store (b) does not create a store or storefront for other code or applications (c) does not bypass signing, sandbox, or other security features of the OS." [\[2\]](https://github.com/Cap-go/capacitor-updater)

### Version Control Implementation

To manage Capacitor OTA updates effectively, developers can use tools like `capacitor-set-version` and `capacitor-sync-version-cli`. These tools simplify version management by [automating updates](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/hybrid-update/) across platforms.

Here’s how to get started:

-   **Automatic Version Synchronization**: Use `capacitor-sync-version-cli` to keep version numbers aligned across all platforms.
    
-   **Build Verification**: Set up checks to confirm commit evidence before each build.
    
-   **Configuration Validation**: Automate the validation of Capacitor settings to avoid configuration errors.
    

Start at version **0.1.0**, and increment the minor version number for each new feature. Following these steps helps reduce errors, but there are still common mistakes to avoid.

### Common Version Control Mistakes

Even with good practices in place, errors can happen. Tools like `capsafe` can help identify and prevent issues specific to each platform. Here’s what to watch out for:

-   **Build Verification**: Automate checks for commit evidence files and ensure build synchronization across platforms.
    
-   **Platform-Specific Versioning**: Keep an eye on iOS and Android version codes to avoid mismatches.
    
-   **Update Validation**: Confirm that OTA updates don’t interfere with the app’s core functionality.
    

For iOS builds, `capsafe` ensures that the `ios/App/public/commit-evidence.json` file is present. This step is critical to avoid deploying outdated web builds [\[3\]](https://github.com/fkirc/capacitor-build-safety). Proper verification ensures updates are reliable and reduces the risk of broken releases.

## OTA Update Management Methods

Choosing the right delivery methods, testing strategies, and update policies is key for managing Capacitor OTA updates. Here’s a breakdown of the main approaches to ensure smooth and efficient updates.

### Partial vs Complete Updates

Deciding between partial and complete updates can affect both app performance and user experience. Partial updates focus on web assets like [JavaScript bundles](https://capgo.app/docs/webapp/bundles/), making them ideal for quick fixes or minor UI adjustments. On the other hand, complete updates are required when native code changes are involved, as they replace the entire app bundle.

| Update Type | Ideal For | Benefits | Things to Keep in Mind |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Partial | Fixing bugs, UI tweaks | Smaller downloads, faster updates | Limited to web content. Ensure changes align with the app's original intent [\[2\]](https://github.com/Cap-go/capacitor-updater). |
| Complete | Native code updates | Comprehensive modifications | Larger downloads and longer installation times. |

For partial updates, you can extract the compiled app bundle from `dist/` or `www/` into the native filesystem to update specific assets without replacing the entire app.

### Phased Releases and Testing

Phased releases allow updates to roll out gradually, reducing risk and giving you time to catch potential issues. Using [App Store Connect](https://developer.apple.com/app-store-connect/)'s phased release system, updates are distributed over seven days, with an increasing percentage of users receiving the update daily:

| Day | Percentage of Users | Suggested Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1–2 | 1–2% | Monitor crash reports and gather feedback. |
| 3–4 | 5–10% | Track performance metrics. |
| 5–6 | 20–50% | Evaluate user engagement. |
| 7   | 100% | Finalize the rollout. |

For example, Supercell’s January 2024 update for "Clash of Clans" employed this strategy. During a 10% rollout phase, they identified a critical bug and paused the release to resolve it, avoiding widespread issues for their global audience [\[4\]](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/update-your-app/release-a-version-update-in-phases).

### Required vs Optional Updates

Striking a balance between app functionality and user experience is crucial when deciding on required or optional updates. For critical fixes, a force update may be necessary, but it should be used sparingly to avoid frustrating users. The Capacitor SDK offers options for update modes, including:

> "We generally don't recommend this mode since it can lead to the splash screen showing for a long time, especially if the user is on a poor network connection."  
> – Capacitor SDK Setup – [Appflow](https://ionic.io/appflow/), regarding Force Update

To maintain a smooth user experience during critical workflows like authentication, consider implementing update-blocking mechanisms. For instance:

```javascript
// Before login  
localStorage.shouldBlockReload = true;

// After successful login  
localStorage.shouldBlockReload = false;
```

Alternatively, background updates allow users to continue using the current version while the new version downloads in the background.

These strategies provide a solid foundation for managing updates effectively while minimizing disruptions. The next section will dive into update policies and security considerations.

## Update Rules and Security

OTA updates require compliance with app store policies and rigorous security protocols.

### App Store Update Policies

Apple and Google Play enforce strict rules to ensure apps remain safe and high-quality. For instance, starting August 31, 2024, Google Play mandates that all new apps and updates target Android 14 (API level 34)[\[8\]](https://developer.android.com/google/play/requirements/target-sdk). Developers can request an extension until November 1, 2024, if they need more time.

Here are some time-based update controls to consider:

| Update Control Method | Description | Benefits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deferred Updates | Postpone updates for 1–90 days after release | Allows for controlled testing and gradual rollout |
| Version Control | Decide which app versions receive updates | Supports staged deployment and testing |
| [Automatic Updates](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/auto-update/) | Set update behavior on managed devices | Simplifies maintenance |

To enforce deadlines, use system notifications. Research shows that consistent, well-planned updates can increase user engagement by up to 200%[\[9\]](https://moldstud.com/articles/p-update-your-app-on-google-play-best-practices-and-tips). Beyond meeting app store rules, ensuring security in your updates is just as critical.

### Update Security Standards

Strong version control is essential for maintaining update integrity, but layered security measures are equally important. Secure OTA updates with encryption, authentication, and integrity checks. Dr. James J. Hunt, founder, CEO, and CTO of aicas, explains:

> "The need for over-the-air updates is being driven by the industry's digital transformation for software and artificial intelligence – both of which require solution providers to rethink the entire DevOps cycle"[\[7\]](https://www.aicas.com/wp/whitepaper/security-aspects-of-over-the-air-ota-updates/)

Key security layers include:

| Security Layer | Implementation | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Encryption | TLS with CA-signed certificates | Protects update packages during transmission |
| Authentication | Hardware-based security keys | Offers stronger protection than file-based keys |
| Integrity Verification | Cryptographic signatures | Confirms update authenticity |
| Rollback Protection | Automatic fallback mechanism | Prevents device bricking during failed updates |

**Steps to enhance update security:**

1.  **Establish Secure Connections**  
    Use TLS with hostname verification and CA-signed certificates to ensure server connections are verified[\[5\]](https://www.iotforall.com/how-to-ensure-ota-update-security).
    
2.  **Protect Update Packages**  
    Encrypt updates and apply digital signatures after encryption. For maximum security, use air-gapped systems for digital signing[\[5\]](https://www.iotforall.com/how-to-ensure-ota-update-security)[\[6\]](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/12/14/security-considerations-for-ota-software-updates-for-iot-gateway-devices).
    
3.  **Implement Recovery Mechanisms**  
    Enable automatic rollback features to handle failed updates effectively[\[6\]](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/12/14/security-considerations-for-ota-software-updates-for-iot-gateway-devices).
    

Dr. Hunt also highlights the importance of OTA updates in advanced technologies:

> "OTA is already a key factor in making autonomous driving systems trustworthy" - Dr. James J. Hunt, founder, CEO, and CTO of aicas[\[7\]](https://www.aicas.com/wp/whitepaper/security-aspects-of-over-the-air-ota-updates/)

The UNECE has approved UN Regulations (UN R155/R156), which provide a framework for secure OTA updates across various industries. These standards ensure updates are safe and reliable.
