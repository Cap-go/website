[Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) [update channels](https://capgo.app/docs/webapp/channels/) let you send over-the-air (OTA) updates to specific user groups. This helps manage multiple app versions, test new features, and roll out updates gradually. Here's what you need to know:

-   **Benefits**:
    
    -   Test updates with smaller groups (e.g., beta users).
    -   Send critical fixes without waiting for app store approval.
    -   Roll back problematic updates instantly.
-   **Setup**:
    
    -   Use tools like Capacitor CLI, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), and [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) CLI.
    -   Assign roles (Admin, Developer, Viewer) to manage permissions.
    -   Integrate with CI/CD tools for automated workflows.
-   **Managing Channels**:
    
    -   Create channels for environments (e.g., production, beta, staging).
    -   Name channels clearly (e.g., `prod`, `beta-internal`, `v2-hotfix`).
    -   Test updates in phases before promoting them to production.
-   **Removing Channels**:
    
    -   Identify unused channels via analytics.
    -   Safely migrate users, archive data, and check dependencies before deletion.

Capgo simplifies this process with tools like real-time analytics, user management, and rollback options. With proper channel setup and maintenance, you can deploy updates faster and more reliably.

## Setting Up Update Channels

Here's how you can create and manage update channels effectively. This guide covers channel creation, configuration, and helpful naming practices.

### Creating a New Channel

To set up a channel using Capgo CLI, follow these steps:

1.  **Initialize the Channel**: Open your terminal and run the following command:
    
    ```bash
    npx @capgo/cli channel create
    ```
    
2.  **Set Up Basic Parameters**: Configure the channel with details like name and version:
    
    ```bash
    npx @capgo/cli channel config --name="beta-testing" --version="1.0.0"
    ```
    
3.  **Confirm the Channel**: Verify that your channel has been created successfully:
    
    ```bash
    npx @capgo/cli channel list
    ```
    

### Channel Settings

When configuring your channel, make sure to focus on these key settings:

| Setting | Purpose | Example Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Channel Name** | Identifies the update stream | prod, beta, staging |
| **Version Pattern** | Specifies the allowed version format | 1.0.\* |
| **User Access** | Determines who gets the updates | specific-group-id |
| **Update Frequency** | Sets when updates are distributed | immediate, scheduled |

These settings help you control how updates are distributed and who receives them.

### Naming and Structure Tips

A clear naming convention ensures your channels stay organized and easy to manage. Here are some suggestions:

-   **Environment-Based Names**
    
    -   `prod` - For production releases
    -   `beta-internal` - For internal testing
    -   `staging-qa` - For quality assurance testing
-   **Version-Specific Channels**
    
    -   `v2-rollout` - For version 2.0 releases
    -   `v2-hotfix` - For urgent fixes
    -   `v2-beta` - For beta testing
-   **Feature-Focused Channels**
    
    -   `feature-payment` - Updates for the payment system
    -   `feature-auth` - Updates for authentication
    -   `feature-ui` - Interface-related updates

Using these naming patterns makes it easier to identify and manage your update streams.

## Channel Update Management

Effectively managing channel updates ensures smooth and reliable deployments. This step builds on earlier channel creation processes, focusing on refining how updates are deployed. Capgo offers tools like targeted user assignments and analytics-based promotion to streamline this process.

### Update Assignment

Assign updates to specific user groups using a clear workflow:

## Removing Update Channels

It's important to know how and when to remove unused update channels. Keeping your channel structure clean ensures your app stays stable and makes managing updates easier.

### Finding Unused Channels

To spot inactive channels, use [Capgo's analytics dashboard](https://capgo.app/docs/webapp/) to analyze usage patterns. Focus on channels that meet these criteria:

-   No active users in the last 30 days
-   No recent updates deployed
-   Beta testing phases fully completed
-   Temporary channels used for testing or old features flagged as unnecessary

Capgo's real-time analytics make it simple to identify channels that are no longer needed.

### Channel Removal Steps

To safely remove an update channel, follow these steps:

| Step | Action | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **User Migration** | Move all active users to other channels | Confirm no users remain |
| **Update Archive** | Archive the channel's history | Verify the archive is complete |
| **Dependencies Check** | Ensure no scripts or workflows depend on the channel | Confirm no active references |
| **Removal Execution** | Run the channel deletion command | Verify the channel is deleted |

Once these steps are complete, double-check the system to confirm everything is functioning correctly.

### Removal Impact Check

Before finalizing the removal, consider these points:

1.  **Update History Assessment**  
    Review the channel's update history to ensure all important data, like performance stats or user feedback, has been saved.
    
2.  **Dependencies**  
    Double-check that no CI/CD pipelines or scripts still reference the channel.
    

After removal, monitor system performance. If any issues arise, Capgo's rollback feature can help you quickly address them.
