## Data Security During Updates

Securing data during live updates is crucial for staying compliant with regulations and protecting user information. It also plays a key role in maintaining user confidence.

### Encryption Requirements

End-to-end encryption is a must for keeping live updates secure in [Capacitor apps](https://capgo.app/blog/capacitor-comprehensive-guide/). It ensures that update data remains protected as it moves from the server to the device. Capgo's live update solution enforces these encryption standards. According to Capgo: "End-to-end encryption. Only your users can decrypt your updates, no one else" [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/). This encryption approach is essential for protecting user data effectively.

### User Data Protection

Capgo's security framework ensures that only authorized users can decrypt updates. By limiting access, it helps protect user data throughout the update process and minimizes the risk of unauthorized access.

## Testing and App Store Submission

Thorough testing before release is critical for a smooth App Store submission and meeting compliance standards.

### Pre-Release Testing

Capgo's user assignment feature allows you to test updates with specific user groups before rolling them out to everyone. This controlled approach ensures your [encryption and data protection](https://capgo.app/docs/cli/migrations/encryption/) strategies are functioning effectively.

Here's an example of how Capgo handled a rollout for over 5,000 users:

> "We rolled out Capgo OTA updates in production for our user base of +5000. We're seeing very smooth operation almost all our users are upto date within minutes of the OTA being deployed to @Capgo." [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

To ensure a successful rollout, follow these steps:

-   Start with internal testing.
-   Expand to a small group of external users.
-   Gradually scale the user base.
-   Monitor update delivery times and success rates.

Once testing is complete, you'll need to document these steps for the App Store review process.

### App Review Guidelines

When submitting your app, it's important to show compliance with Apple's guidelines.
