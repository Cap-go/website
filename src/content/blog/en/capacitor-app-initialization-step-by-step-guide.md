## Required Tools and Setup

Here's how to set up your development environment with the essential tools.

### Development Tools Installation

To work with Capacitor, you'll need the following tools:

| Tool | Purpose | Minimum Version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js | JavaScript runtime environment | 14.0.0 or higher |
| npm | Package manager | 6.0.0 or higher |
| IDE/Code Editor | Development environment | Latest stable version |
| Git | Version control | 2.0.0 or higher |

Follow these steps to install them:

-   **Node.js and npm**: Download and install both from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org).
-   **Code Editor**: Pick an editor like VS Code, [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and install the latest stable version.
-   **Git**: Get it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com).
-   **Platform-specific tools**: Install tools specific to your platform, like [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for macOS or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) for Android development.

Once these are installed, you're ready to move on to setting up the Capacitor CLI.

### Capacitor CLI Setup

Get the Capacitor CLI up and running with these steps:

1.  **Install Capacitor CLI globally**
    
    Open your terminal and run the following command:
    
    ```bash
    npm install -g @capacitor/cli
    ```
    
2.  **Initialize Capgo plugin**
    
    If you haven't done this yet, run:
    
    ```bash
    npx @capgo/cli init
    ```
    
    This will configure the necessary settings to [manage updates](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/manual-update/) effectively [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/). It simplifies the process for building, testing, and deploying your app.
    

## Starting a New Capacitor Project

Once you've installed the necessary tools, you're ready to set up your first Capacitor project. Here's how to get started.

### Creating Your Project

To create a new Capacitor project, open your terminal and use this command:

```
npx @capacitor/cli create [projectDirectory] [appId] [appDisplayName]
```

For example:

```
npx @capacitor/cli create my-cap-app com.example.app "My Capacitor App"
```

Here’s what each parameter means:

-   **projectDirectory**: The name of your project folder (e.g., `my-cap-app`).
-   **appId**: A reverse-domain identifier for your app (e.g., `com.example.app`).
-   **appDisplayName**: The name displayed for your app (e.g., `My Capacitor App`).

After running this command, you’ll need to adjust your project settings in the `capacitor.config.json` file.

### Configuring capacitor.config.json

The `capacitor.config.json` file is where you define the key settings for your project. Below is an example of a basic configuration:

```json
{
  "appId": "com.example.app",
  "appName": "My Capacitor App",
  "webDir": "dist",
  "bundledWebRuntime": false,
  "server": {
    "hostname": "app.example.com",
    "androidScheme": "https",
    "iosScheme": "https"
  }
}
```

Here’s a breakdown of the key options:

| Setting | Purpose | Example Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **appId** | Unique identifier for your app | `com.example.app` |
| **appName** | The app’s display name | `My Capacitor App` |
| **webDir** | Directory for build output | `dist` |
| **bundledWebRuntime** | Whether to include Capacitor runtime | `false` |
| **server.hostname** | Hostname for the dev server | `app.example.com` |
| **server.androidScheme** | URL scheme for Android | `https` |
| **server.iosScheme** | URL scheme for iOS | `https` |

### Installing Dependencies

To finalize the setup, install the required dependencies and initialize your project with these commands:

```
npm install @capacitor/core
npm install @capacitor/cli --save-dev
npx cap init
```

With these steps completed, your project is ready for platform-specific setup and development.

## Setting Up Mobile Platforms

Once your Capacitor project is initialized, the next step is to add and configure the iOS and Android platforms so your app can run natively on mobile devices.

### iOS and Android Setup

Start by adding platform support using the following commands:

```bash
npx cap add ios
npx cap add android
```

After adding the platforms, sync your web code with:

```bash
npx cap sync
```

Before running these commands, make sure your web application is built and that the `webDir` in `capacitor.config.json` is correctly set. Once that's done, customize each platform's settings to align with your app's needs.

### Platform-Specific Settings

#### iOS

Open the iOS project with:

```bash
npx cap open ios
```

Then, configure the following settings:

-   **Bundle Identifier**: Ensure it matches your appId.
-   **Development Team**: Assign the appropriate team for code signing.
-   **Deployment Target**: Set the minimum iOS version.
-   **Device Orientation**: Adjust as needed.
-   **Privacy Descriptions**: Add required descriptions in `Info.plist`.

#### Android

Open the Android project with:

```bash
npx cap open android
```

Then, update these settings:

-   **Package Name**: Ensure it matches your appId.
-   **Permissions**: Define necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`.
-   **Screen Orientation**: Configure this in `AndroidManifest.xml`.
-   **Target SDK**: Set the appropriate version in `android/app/build.gradle`.

### Asset and Configuration Locations

Here’s where you’ll find key files for app icons, splash screens, deep links, and permissions:

| Configuration | iOS Location | Android Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App Icons | `ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets` | `android/app/src/main/res` |
| Splash Screens | `ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets` | `android/app/src/main/res` |
| Deep Links | `ios/App/App/Info.plist` | `AndroidManifest.xml` |
| Permissions | `Info.plist` | `AndroidManifest.xml` |

With these configurations in place, you’re ready to build and test your app on mobile devices.

## Building and Testing

Using the setup outlined earlier, you can now build and test your [Capacitor app](https://capgo.app/plugins/ivs-player/) to ensure it works correctly on various devices.

### Build and Run Commands

Once your app is configured for mobile platforms, it's time to build and run tests. Start by updating your web assets:

```bash
npm run build
npx cap sync
```

Next, use the appropriate commands for your target platform:

**For iOS:**

```bash
npx cap run ios
```

**For Android:**

```bash
npx cap run android
```

These commands will build and launch your app on either a simulator or a connected device. Testing on both real devices and simulators is crucial to identify any platform-specific issues.

### Adding Capacitor Plugins

[Capacitor plugins](https://capgo.app/plugins/) allow you to add native features to your app. For example, to include camera, geolocation, and storage capabilities, run:

```bash
npm install @capacitor/camera @capacitor/geolocation @capacitor/storage
npx cap sync
```

After installation, configure the plugins in your native projects. Here's a quick overview of the setup requirements:

| **Plugin** | **iOS Configuration** | **Android Configuration** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Camera | Add [Privacy Description](https://capgo.app/privacy/) | Add Permissions to Manifest |
| Geolocation | Add Location Usage Description | Add Location Permissions |
| Storage | No additional setup needed | No additional setup needed |

### Live Updates with [Capgo](https://capgo.app/)

To simplify deployment and testing, you can integrate live update tools like Capgo. This service has already delivered over 23.5 million updates, with 95% of users receiving updates within 24 hours and an 82% global success rate [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

To add Capgo to your app:

```bash
npm install @capgo/capacitor-updater
npx cap sync
```

Capgo offers several benefits during testing:

-   Create separate channels for development, staging, and production environments.
-   Push immediate bug fixes during testing.
-   Track update success rates with built-in analytics.
-   Roll back updates quickly if issues arise.

Capgo also ensures secure update delivery with end-to-end encryption. Its channel system allows you to test updates with select user groups before rolling them out to everyone.

## Summary

This guide has walked through every phase of setting up and deploying a Capacitor app, covering all the essential steps needed to get started and ensure smooth operation.

### Main Points

Creating a Capacitor app requires careful attention to setup, configuration, and platform-specific adjustments. Setting up your development environment - including tools like **Node.js** and the **Capacitor CLI** - is a crucial starting point. Configuring platforms like iOS and Android ensures the app works seamlessly on native systems.

Using an update system such as **Capgo** can simplify release management and help maintain app stability [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).
