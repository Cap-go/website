Once you've chosen a plugin, the next step is to set up your Capacitor app to enable SSL pinning. Here's an example of what your configuration might look like:

```typescript
// Example: capacitor.config.ts
{
  appId: 'com.example.app',
  plugins: {
    SSLPinning: {
      certs: ['cert1', 'cert2'],
      validateCertificates: true,
      allowBackup: false
    }
  }
}
```

It's a good idea to roll out these changes gradually to ensure a smooth transition for users. After setting up the general configuration, move on to platform-specific adjustments for Android and iOS to complete the implementation.

## Platform-Specific Setup

Setting up SSL pinning requires tailored configurations for Android and iOS to guard against MITM attacks effectively.

### Android Implementation

On Android, SSL pinning involves setting up network security configurations and managing certificates. Here's how to do it:

-   **Create a Network Security Configuration**
    
    Start by creating a file named `network_security_config.xml` in the `res/xml` directory of your Android project:
    
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <network-security-config>
        <domain-config>
            <domain includeSubdomains="true">api.example.com</domain>
            <pin-set>
                <pin digest="SHA-256">your_certificate_hash</pin>
                <!-- Backup pin -->
                <pin digest="SHA-256">backup_certificate_hash</pin>
            </pin-set>
        </domain-config>
    </network-security-config>
    ```
    
-   **Update the AndroidManifest.xml File**
    
    Reference the newly created network security configuration in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
    
    ```xml
    <application
        android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config"
        ...>
    ```
    
-   **Add Certificate Files**
    
    Store the required certificate files (`.cer` or `.pem`) in the `res/raw` directory of your Android project.
    

### iOS Implementation

For iOS, SSL pinning is configured by modifying App Transport Security (ATS) settings and implementing runtime certificate validation. Follow these steps:

-   **Set Up ATS in Info.plist**
    
    Add the following configuration to your app's `Info.plist` file:
    
    ```xml
    <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
    <dict>
        <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
        <false/>
        <key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
        <dict>
            <key>api.example.com</key>
            <dict>
                <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
                <true/>
                <key>NSPinnedDomains</key>
                <true/>
            </dict>
        </dict>
    </dict>
    ```
    
-   **Initialize SSL Pinning in Code**
    
    Use the following code snippet to enable SSL pinning during app initialization:
    
    ```typescript
    import { HTTP } from '@ionic-native/http/ngx';
    
    export class AppComponent {
      constructor(private http: HTTP) {
        this.initializeSSLPinning();
      }
    
      async initializeSSLPinning() {
        try {
          await this.http.setSSLCertMode('pinned');
          console.log('SSL Pinning initialized successfully');
        } catch (error) {
          console.error('SSL Pinning initialization failed:', error);
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    

### Comparison of Android and iOS Implementations

Here's a quick comparison of how SSL pinning differs between Android and iOS:

| Feature | Android | iOS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Configuration File | `network_security_config.xml` | `Info.plist` |
| Certificate Location | `res/raw` directory | App bundle |
| Validation Method | XML configuration | ATS and runtime validation |
| Plugin Support | Native + custom plugins | Native + custom plugins |

Next, we’ll dive into testing strategies and common mistakes to help you ensure your SSL pinning setup is reliable and secure.

## Testing and Fixes

Testing your SSL pinning setup is essential to prevent Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks. Here's how to ensure your implementation is secure and troubleshoot common issues.

### MITM Attack Testing

You can use proxy tools like Charles Proxy to simulate MITM attacks and verify your SSL pinning setup.

**Charles Proxy Testing**

Follow these steps to test with Charles Proxy:

1.  Install the Charles root certificate on your device.
2.  Enable SSL Proxying in the Charles settings.
3.  Add your API domain to the SSL proxying list.
4.  Configure your device to route traffic through the Charles proxy.

If your SSL pinning is correctly implemented, you should see certificate validation errors in your application logs during the test.

**Network Configuration Testing**

Use the following code snippet to validate the connection with a pinned certificate:

```typescript
// Validate pinned certificate connection
try {
    const response = await Http.get({
        url: 'https://api.example.com/test',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
    });
    console.log('Connection successful');
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Certificate validation failed:', error);
}
```

### Common Error Solutions

Here are some typical SSL pinning issues and how to address them:

| **Error Type** | **Common Cause** | **Solution** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Certificate Mismatch | Incorrect hash in configuration | Verify the certificate hash using [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/). |
| Path Issues | Wrong certificate location | Check the platform-specific certificate paths. |
| Format Problems | Invalid certificate format | Convert the certificate to the correct format (e.g., PEM or DER). |
| Network Timeout | Incorrect pinning configuration | Verify your network security settings. |

**Verifying Certificate Hash**

To ensure the certificate hash matches your configuration, use the following OpenSSL command:

```bash
# Generate the correct certificate hash
openssl x509 -in certificate.pem -pubkey -noout | \
openssl rsa -pubin -outform der | \
openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | base64
```

After addressing any errors, ensure your certificate update process is functioning correctly.

### Certificate Update Testing

Include both a primary and a backup certificate in your configuration to prevent service downtime during updates.

**Update Testing Process**

Here’s an example of how to test certificate rotation:

```typescript
// Rotate certificates
const certificates = {
    current: 'sha256/current_certificate_hash',
    backup: 'sha256/backup_certificate_hash'
};

// Test both certificates
async function validateCertificates() {
    try {
        await testConnection(certificates.current);
        console.log('Primary certificate valid');
    } catch {
        try {
            await testConnection(certificates.backup);
            console.log('Backup certificate valid');
        } catch {
            console.error('All certificates invalid');
        }
    }
}
```

**Monitoring Certificate Expiry**

Regularly check for certificate expiration to avoid disruptions:

```bash
# Check certificate expiration date
openssl x509 -enddate -noout -in certificate.pem
```

Finally, test your setup under various conditions, including stable WiFi, mobile data, offline scenarios, and network transitions, to ensure robust security and functionality.

## SSL Pinning Management

Once your SSL pinning setup is in place, the next step is managing certificate and key pinning to maintain strong security over time.

### Certificate vs. Key Pinning

When it comes to SSL pinning, there are two main approaches: certificate pinning and public key pinning. Each has its own strengths, especially for [Capacitor apps](https://capgo.app/blog/capacitor-comprehensive-guide/):

| Feature | Certificate Pinning | Public Key Pinning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Security Level** | High – pins the entire certificate | Very high – pins only the public key |
| **Maintenance** | Updates required with each renewal | Less frequent, survives renewals |
| **Implementation** | Easier to implement | More complex initial setup |
| **Storage Impact** | Larger storage footprint | Minimal storage requirements |
| **Update Frequency** | Every certificate renewal | Only when the public key changes |

This breakdown can help you decide which method aligns best with your app’s long-term maintenance strategy.
