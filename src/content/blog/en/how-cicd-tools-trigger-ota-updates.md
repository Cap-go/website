CI/CD tools make over-the-air (OTA) updates faster, safer, and more reliable by automating the process. Here's how:

-   **What Are OTA Updates?** They let you update app assets like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript instantly via a CDN, skipping app store approval delays.
-   **How CI/CD Helps:** Automation tools like [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions) streamline key steps like build checks, security validation, and deployment, cutting errors by 72% and enabling same-day patches.
-   **Key Features:**
    -   **Security:** Use HTTPS, code signing, and encryption to protect updates.
    -   **Staged Rollouts:** Deploy updates to small groups first to catch issues early.
    -   **Rollback Options:** Automatically revert updates if error rates rise.
-   **Tools Highlighted:** [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) simplifies OTA updates with CLI commands, webhook integration, and detailed metrics tracking.

Automating OTA updates ensures faster delivery, fewer errors, and better app stability. Below, you'll find step-by-step instructions to set up [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) apps with CI/CD pipelines.

## Preparing [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) for OTA Updates

![Capacitor](https://mars-images.imgix.net/seobot/screenshots/capacitorjs.com-4c1a6a7e452082d30f5bff9840b00b7d-2025-02-12.jpg?auto=compress)

Setting up Capacitor for [automated over-the-air](https://capgo.app/blog/open-source-licecing/) (OTA) updates involves three key steps: configuring the setup, implementing security measures, and [integrating an update system](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/hybrid-update). This process ensures compatibility with CI/CD automation while keeping your app secure.

### Configuring OTA Settings in capacitor.config.json

Start by updating the `capacitor.config.json` file with the necessary parameters:

```json
{
  "appId": "com.example.app",
  "appVersion": "2.3.1",
  "plugins": {
    "CapacitorUpdater": {
      "updateUrl": "https://api.example.com/ota",
      "checkFrequency": 3600,
      "channel": "production"
    }
  }
}
```

Setting an appropriate check frequency minimizes update delays - reducing them by up to 47% [\[2\]](https://github.com/becem-gharbi/esp-ota-cicd).

### Implementing OTA Update Security

Securing the OTA update process is essential to avoid unauthorized updates and protect your app's integrity. This involves three layers of protection:

| Security Layer | Implementation | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTPS Security | Certificate Pinning | Blocks man-in-the-middle attacks |
| Code Signing | ed25519 Signatures | Confirms the update's validity |
| Package Security | AES-256-GCM Encryption | Safeguards the update content |

To apply these security features, include the following in your configuration:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "publicKey": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----...",
    "requireSignedUpdates": true,
    "validateChecksums": true
  }
}
```

### Configuring [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) for OTA Updates

![Capgo](https://mars-images.imgix.net/seobot/screenshots/capgo.app-26aea05b7e2e737b790a9becb40f7bc5-2025-02-12.jpg?auto=compress)

Capgo simplifies the OTA update process. Begin by installing the required plugin:

```bash
npm install @capgo/capacitor-updater
```

Next, add Capgo-specific settings to your `capacitor.config.json` file:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "CapacitorUpdater": {
      "apiKey": "CAPGO_XXXX",
      "channel": "production",
      "debug": true
    }
  }
}
```

Capgo uses semantic versioning with build identifiers like `2025.02.12-a1b2c3d` for precise update tracking. This makes it easier to manage and monitor your app's update lifecycle.

## Creating OTA Update Pipelines

Once you've set up Capgo in your Capacitor environment, the next step is linking it with CI/CD tools to automate update delivery. This ensures updates are handled securely and efficiently while keeping your app stable.

### Webhook Setup for Auto-Updates

Webhooks in your CI/CD setup can automatically trigger updates whenever code changes occur. For example, in GitHub Actions, you can create a workflow file like this:

```yaml
name: OTA Update Trigger
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Trigger OTA Update
        run: |
          curl -X POST \
          -H "X-Capgo-Signature: sha256=${{ secrets.CAPGO_SECRET }}" \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.CAPGO_API_KEY }}" \
          https://api.capgo.app/deploy
```

Make sure to store your API keys and secrets securely in your CI/CD platform's [encrypted storage](https://capgo.app/docs/cli/migrations/encryption/) to protect sensitive data.

### Capgo CLI Update Commands

The Capgo CLI offers key commands to streamline update management within your pipeline. Hereâ€™s an example of a typical deployment workflow:

| Stage | Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Build | `capgo deploy --channel production` | Upload new build artifacts |
| Testing | `capgo promote build-123 --group beta` | [Release updates to a test group](https://capgo.app/blog/how-to-send-specific-version-to-users/) |
| Validation | `capgo metrics get --last-24h` | Check update success metrics |
| Release | `capgo promote build-123 --channel stable` | Deploy the update to all users |

### Update Rollback Methods

Having a reliable rollback mechanism is essential to keep your app stable. Your system should be able to detect problems and revert updates automatically. For example, you can use health check endpoints to monitor error rates and trigger rollbacks if needed:

```bash
# Rollback script triggered by monitoring
if [ $(curl -s https://api.capgo.app/metrics/errors) -gt 5 ]; then
  capgo rollback v1.2 --channel production
  notify-team "Update rolled back due to high error rate"
fi
```

This approach helped [Gunnebo Safe Storage](https://www.gunnebosafestorage.com/) cut downtime from hours to minutes [\[6\]](https://mender.io/blog/mender-ota-updates-and-an-automated-ci-cd-pipeline-at-gunnebo-safe-storage).

For high-risk updates, consider using Capgo's staged rollout feature. It allows you to deploy updates to smaller user groups first, reducing the chance of widespread issues before a full release.

## OTA Update Methods

### Staged Updates and User Groups

Staged updates let you control how updates are rolled out, ensuring a smooth experience for users. For example, Capgo's _promote_ command (discussed earlier) helps manage beta groups. With enterprise data showing that nearly half of apps (49%) need monthly updates [\[4\]](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/guides/ci-cd), staged deployment becomes a key strategy to keep apps stable while rolling out changes gradually.

### Metric-Based Update Triggers

[Automating updates](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/hybrid-update/) based on performance metrics can save time and prevent issues. By setting up monitoring webhooks, you can track important metrics and decide whether to continue or pause an update:

| Metric Type | Threshold | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Crash Rate | \>2% | Pause rollout |
| Error Rate | \>0.5% | Alert team |

You can integrate these checks into your CI/CD pipeline for seamless monitoring. Here's an example:

```bash
if [ $(curl -s $MONITORING_API/crash-rate) -gt 2 ]; then
  capgo pause-rollout --channel production
  notify-team "Update paused: High crash rate detected"
fi
```

These metrics directly tie into the performance tracking system, which we'll explore in the next section.

### Quick Response Updates

When facing critical security issues or major bugs, it's important to have a way to deploy updates quickly. Use fast-track deployment channels specifically designed for emergencies. These channels should include device attestation checks and automated rollback options to minimize risks.

For urgent updates, you can deploy using a dedicated channel:

```bash
capgo deploy --critical --channel hotfix
```

To further improve delivery speed and meet compliance standards, consider using geo-based channels with CDN rules. This ensures updates reach users efficiently, regardless of location.

## Update Performance Tracking

Once you've put update delivery methods in place, it's time to measure how well they're working. Use these key performance indicators to stay on top of things:

### Update Success Metrics

Pay attention to three main areas: **deployment completion**, **verification time**, and **user adoption**. For mobile apps, deployment success rates typically range between 95% and 99% [\[1\]](https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2024/01/15/exploring-serverless-ci-cd-for-embedded-devices/). Real-time monitoring through your CI/CD pipeline can help you hit your targets:

| Metric | Target | Critical Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deployment Completion | \>98% | <95% |
| Verification Time | <45s | \>120s |
| User Adoption (24h) | \>75% | <50% |

### Update Error Management

Automated systems can track update statuses and respond to errors. For major issues, the system should roll back updates automatically if device health checks detect problems. Here's an example of how this might look in practice:

```bash
if [ $DEVICE_SUCCESS_RATE -lt 85 ]; then
    trigger_rollback
fi
```

This kind of setup ensures that critical failures are addressed quickly, minimizing disruption for users.

### Data Usage Reduction

Delta updates are a great way to cut down on data usage, shrinking payload sizes by 70â€“90% compared to full updates [\[4\]](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/guides/ci-cd). These optimizations can be built right into your CI/CD pipeline with rules like these:

-   **Delta Updates**: Create binary diffs to include only the components that have changed.
-   **Asset Optimization**: Convert images to formats like WebP or AVIF to reduce file sizes.
-   **Scheduled Off-peak Deployments**: Roll out updates during times of lower network traffic to minimize impact.

## Conclusion: Automated OTA Updates

With automated OTA updates integrated into CI/CD pipelines, Capacitor deployments can move from weekly cycles to hourly updates. [JFrog](https://jfrog.com/) highlights this efficiency boost, noting an **85% faster deployment rate** for Capacitor apps [\[3\]](https://jfrog.com/blog/devops-and-cicd-for-iot/) and **95% adoption rates** in stable networks [\[5\]](https://qbee.io/iot-ota/). These results come from removing manual steps and simplifying the update process.

For development teams, this approach offers clear advantages. Among [ESP-IDF](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/sdks/esp-idf) users, **73% of teams** now use pre-merge CI checks [\[1\]](https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2024/01/15/exploring-serverless-ci-cd-for-embedded-devices/)[\[2\]](https://github.com/becem-gharbi/esp-ota-cicd), leading to higher-quality releases before production. These efforts align with the earlier discussion on data-driven deployment strategies.

Automated pipelines also ensure updates are delivered reliably using compressed formats and delta updates. By combining automated testing, phased rollouts, and performance tracking, teams can manage Capacitor app updates with both efficiency and security.
