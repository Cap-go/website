| Build Speed | Prioritizes faster builds | Speeds up testing cycles |
| Source Maps | Uncompressed and enabled | Makes debugging easier |
| Debug Logging | Verbose logging activated | Helps pinpoint issues |
| Resource Usage | Higher memory use | Supports development tools |

In this mode, performance sacrifices are intentional to ensure developers can iterate and debug quickly. Production mode, however, shifts the focus entirely to user experience and optimization.

### Production Mode Performance

When transitioning to production, the focus shifts to delivering a seamless user experience with efficient resource use. Capgo users have reported an **81% efficiency improvement** in production, highlighting the impact of proper configuration [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

| **Performance Aspect** | **Production Mode Approach** | **User Impact** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Code Size | Minified and compressed | Leads to faster load times |
| Resource Usage | Optimized for efficiency | Ensures smoother performance |
| Update Delivery | Streamlined process | Delivers features quickly |
| Error Handling | Minimal logging with graceful recovery | Improves user satisfaction |

Feedback from users backs this up. For instance, @colenso shared:

> "We rolled out Capgo OTA updates in production for our user base of +5000. We're seeing very smooth operation almost all our users are up to date within minutes of the OTA being deployed to @Capgo." [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

Rodrigo Mantica (@manticarodrigo) emphasizes the importance of this approach:

> "We practice agile development and @Capgo is mission-critical in delivering continuously to our users!" [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

In short, development mode is all about speed and debugging, while production mode focuses on creating a polished, efficient experience for the end user. Each has its own purpose, and understanding these differences is crucial for effective app lifecycle management.
