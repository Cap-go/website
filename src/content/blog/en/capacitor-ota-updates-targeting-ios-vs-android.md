Capgo helps streamline the process, ensuring updates are secure, efficient, and compliant across both platforms. Whether you're targeting iOS or Android, understanding these differences will help you create a better OTA [update strategy](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/hybrid-update).

## How iOS and Android Handle OTA Updates

iOS and Android take different approaches when it comes to managing OTA (over-the-air) updates, both in their technical execution and approval processes.

### iOS App Store Update Rules

Apple has strict guidelines for OTA updates. Devices must meet specific technical conditions: they need to run iOS 5 or later, be connected to a stable Wi‑Fi network, and either have at least 50% battery life or be plugged into a power source [\[5\]](https://osxdaily.com/2011/11/10/ios-ota-update-not-working-fix/). Beyond these technical requirements, Apple enforces a rigorous review process that evaluates updates for safety, performance, business compliance, design, and legal standards [\[4\]](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/).

### Google Play Store Update Rules

Google Play operates differently, using a staged rollout system. Updates start with a small release to 1% of users for 24–48 hours and then expand, often in 25% increments, until they reach full deployment within one to two weeks [\[7\]](https://www.phonearena.com/news/Google-engineer-Dan-Morrill-talks-about-Android-OTA-updates-and-why-you-need-to-be-patient_id49573). Since August 2023, all new Android versions must target the highest available API level [\[3\]](https://applandeo.com/blog/upcoming-google-play-a-appstore-updates-how-will-they-affect-your-mobile-app/). Additionally, Android employs streaming updates, which help reduce the need for extra storage space during the [update process](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/manual-update/) [\[8\]](https://source.android.com/docs/core/ota/ab).

### Platform Update Differences

The key distinctions between iOS and Android OTA updates are outlined below:

| Feature | iOS | Android |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Update Deployment | Immediate full release | Staged rollout (1% → 25% → 50% → 100%) |
| Background Updates | Limited | Supports A/B updates in the background [\[8\]](https://source.android.com/docs/core/ota/ab) |
| Storage Management | Requires full download | Supports streaming updates [\[8\]](https://source.android.com/docs/core/ota/ab) |
| Power Requirements | At least 50% battery or plugged in [\[5\]](https://osxdaily.com/2011/11/10/ios-ota-update-not-working-fix/) | Flexible power requirements |
| Network Requirements | Wi‑Fi connection required [\[5\]](https://osxdaily.com/2011/11/10/ios-ota-update-not-working-fix/) | Supports various connection types |

Android's A/B update system stands out for allowing updates to install in the background without interrupting the user. This system uses two slots for boot-critical partitions, avoiding the need for duplicate partitions and optimizing storage compared to older methods [\[6\]](https://source.android.com/docs/core/ota). On the other hand, iOS follows a more controlled and immediate update process, prioritizing stability and user oversight.

## User Groups and Update Distribution

When it comes to update distribution, strategies need to account for the unique constraints of various devices and operating systems.

### Device-Based Update Rules

Update requirements depend heavily on the hardware and platform. For instance, iOS devices need at least 20% battery for user-initiated updates and 30% for [automatic updates](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/auto-update/). On Macs, the requirements differ based on the chipset - 20% battery for Apple silicon devices and 50% for Intel-based ones [\[10\]](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/about-software-updates-depc4c80847a/web). Android, on the other hand, has a more flexible system but faces challenges due to ecosystem fragmentation. Manufacturers and carriers introduce delays, with security updates taking an average of 24 days and an additional 11 days for device-specific completions [\[11\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3372297.3423346).

### OS Version Requirements

Operating system requirements play a key role in how updates are distributed. For Android apps, Google Play enforces the following:

| Timeframe | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| After August 31, 2024 | New apps must target Android 14 (API 34+) |
| Current | Existing apps must target Android 13 (API 33+) |
| Legacy | Apps targeting Android 12 or lower must comply with existing OS versions |

For iOS, Apple uses Rapid Security Response (RSR) to deliver critical patches directly to the latest OS versions [\[10\]](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/about-software-updates-depc4c80847a/web). Capgo ensures compatibility with devices running iOS 13.0+ and Android API level 22+ [\[9\]](https://capgo.app/docs/faq/).

### Update Strategy Results

Android's [Project Treble](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html) has reduced the time required for security updates by about 7 days [\[11\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3372297.3423346). To manage updates effectively, it's recommended to separate development and production [update channels](https://capgo.app/docs/webapp/channels/) [\[9\]](https://capgo.app/docs/faq/). Capgo simplifies the process with percentage-based deployments, allowing for controlled rollouts while staying within app store guidelines.

The updater also caches downloaded bundles in platform-specific directories for efficient and secure updates:

-   **Android**: `/data/user/0/com.example.app/code_cache/capgo_updater`
    
-   **iOS**: `Library/Application Support/capgo`
    

This caching system ensures smooth and reliable updates [\[9\]](https://capgo.app/docs/faq/).

## Update Speed and Efficiency

The speed and efficiency of OTA (Over-the-Air) updates play a huge role in shaping user experience on both iOS and Android. Two factors that heavily influence this are network conditions and how well file sizes are managed.

### File Size and Network Management

Keeping file sizes optimized is crucial for smooth OTA updates. For instance, Capgo's updater runs update checks in a background thread during app startup, ensuring the user interface stays responsive [\[9\]](https://capgo.app/docs/faq/). It also supports JavaScript updates while locking native code (like Java/Kotlin or Objective-C/Swift) to maintain stability [\[9\]](https://capgo.app/docs/faq/).

### Update Speed Comparison

Even with smaller file sizes, update speed is still a major factor. iOS often has an edge here due to its tightly integrated hardware and software, which can process updates faster [\[14\]](https://www.simplymac.com/iphone/android-vs-iphone-comparison-of-features-and-performance). On the other hand, Android's wide range of hardware can sometimes lead to uneven update performance [\[13\]](https://flexiple.com/compare/android-vs-ios)[\[14\]](https://www.simplymac.com/iphone/android-vs-iphone-comparison-of-features-and-performance).

> "Instantly deploying live updates to users is one of the most critical benefits of Appflow, Ionic's mobile CI/CD platform."  
> – Cecelia Martinez, Developer Advocate [\[12\]](https://ionic.io/blog/the-future-of-live-updates-is-here-and-its-more-performant-than-ever)

To improve update efficiency, strategies like differential updates and leveraging native functionality are key. Capacitor, for example, shifts certain operations to the native layer. When paired with differential updates, this approach cuts down both update times and data usage [\[12\]](https://ionic.io/blog/the-future-of-live-updates-is-here-and-its-more-performant-than-ever). Considering Android's dominant market share - over 70% globally as of March 2023 [\[13\]](https://flexiple.com/compare/android-vs-ios) - delivering efficient updates is especially important to maintain consistent performance across its varied devices.

## Security Rules and Requirements

When it comes to OTA updates, iOS and Android take distinct approaches to ensure data protection and system security, each using its own set of tailored protocols.

### iOS Security Standards

Apple's update process is tightly controlled and designed with strict security in mind. iOS devices rely on **hardware-backed encryption**, using two built-in AES 256-bit keys unique to each device [\[17\]](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/0x06a-Platform-Overview/). Every device also includes a unique hardware-based UID with an integrated AES 256-bit key [\[17\]](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/0x06a-Platform-Overview/). Updates are verified for integrity, customized for individual devices, and come with safeguards against downgrade attacks. Apple also isolates user data during updates to prevent security risks [\[10\]](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/about-software-updates-depc4c80847a/web). A standout feature is Apple's **Rapid Security Responses**, allowing quick deployment of security patches without requiring a full system update [\[10\]](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/about-software-updates-depc4c80847a/web).

### Android Security Standards

Android builds its security on a Linux-based foundation, focusing on user isolation and system-level protections. Each app is assigned a unique UID, while **SELinux** enforces mandatory access control. The **Verified Boot** feature ensures code authenticity [\[18\]](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features). For OTA updates, Android utilizes a **Virtual A/B partition system** (with compression for devices running Android 11 and later), a hardware-backed Keystore for cryptographic tasks, and updates delivered through OEMs and carriers [\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-air_update).

| Feature | iOS | Android |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Update Distribution | Centralized through Apple | Distributed via OEMs/carriers |
| Security Verification | Hardware-backed encryption | SELinux + Verified Boot |
| Patch Delivery | Rapid Security Responses | Project Mainline modules |
| Update Authentication | Device-specific UID | Verified Boot |

### Security Requirements Comparison

The differences in these frameworks highlight how each platform's architecture shapes its security approach. iOS operates within a "walled garden" model, offering tight control and standardized security measures. In contrast, Android's open ecosystem provides more flexibility in update mechanisms but can sometimes face fragmentation challenges [\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-air_update). These security structures directly influence the reliability of OTA updates.

For developers working with tools like Capgo, understanding these distinctions is key. iOS enforces stricter app isolation and limits system API access [\[17\]](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/0x06a-Platform-Overview/), while Android's broader inter-process communication options demand careful security management [\[18\]](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features). As of February 2025, with iOS 18.3.1 and various Android versions in use [\[16\]](https://support.apple.com/en-us/100100), developers must ensure their OTA update strategies align with the latest security standards for each platform.

## [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) Platform Overview

![Capgo](https://mars-images.imgix.net/seobot/screenshots/capgo.app-26aea05b7e2e737b790a9becb40f7bc5-2025-03-01.jpg?auto=compress)

Capgo brings together platform-specific OTA update rules into one streamlined update platform.

By working with iOS and Android security protocols, Capgo ensures seamless OTA update management. To date, it has delivered **947.6 million updates** across **1,400 production apps** [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

### Capgo Key Functions

Capgo focuses on solving update challenges with secure, efficient, and compliant delivery. Updates are protected with **end-to-end encryption**, and decryption happens only on user devices [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/). For iOS, it uses a custom Dart interpreter to align with Apple's interpreter-only update rule [\[9\]](https://capgo.app/docs/faq/). On Android, it supports API level 22 and above, in line with Capacitor's requirements [\[9\]](https://capgo.app/docs/faq/).

| Feature | Implementation | Platform Support |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Update Delivery | Instant deployment | iOS 13.0+, Android API 22+ |
| Security | End-to-end encryption | Both platforms |
| CI/CD Integration | Works with Azure DevOps, GitHub, GitLab | Cross-platform |

| Version Control | Rollback capability | Both platforms |

### Cross-Platform Update Management

Capgo's channel system gives developers precise control over updates for iOS and Android. This system allows for:

-   Separate update channels for iOS and Android
    
-   Uploading [distinct bundles](https://capgo.app/docs/webapp/bundles/) with optional cross-channel linking
    
-   Automatic detection of native code changes [\[9\]](https://capgo.app/docs/faq/)
    

The platform's real-world impact is clear. For example, NASA's [OSIRIS-REx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSIRIS-REx) team shared:

> "@Capgo is a smart way to make hot code pushes (and not for all the money in the world like with @AppFlow) :-)" [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

Capgo can adjust any JavaScript code, including app and generated code, but it strictly avoids modifying native code (such as Java/Kotlin for Android or Objective-C/Swift for iOS) [\[9\]](https://capgo.app/docs/faq/).

## Conclusion

OTA updates for [Capacitor apps](https://capgo.app/blog/capacitor-comprehensive-guide/) require different approaches for iOS and Android due to platform-specific rules. For iOS, there are stricter controls, such as the file path restriction that limits server paths to "/Library/NoCloud/ionic\_built\_snapshots" [\[2\]](https://capgo.app/blog/how-live-updates-for-capacitor-work/). Meanwhile, Android allows more freedom, with fewer limitations on virtual machines and interpreters accessing APIs [\[2\]](https://capgo.app/blog/how-live-updates-for-capacitor-work/). These differences highlight the importance of creating update strategies that align with each platform's framework.

Data from platforms like Capgo demonstrates how effective these strategies can be. Developers have successfully delivered 947.6 million updates across 1,400 production apps, proving the scalability of well-designed update systems [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/). However, success relies heavily on meeting each platform's requirements while maintaining strong security measures.

For example, Apple mandates that interpreted code must not alter an app's core functionality or compromise its security [\[2\]](https://capgo.app/blog/how-live-updates-for-capacitor-work/). This rule is a clear reminder of the platform-specific guidelines developers must follow to implement OTA updates effectively.
