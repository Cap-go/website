Once your data is mapped, ensure your privacy policy reflects these practices accurately.

### Privacy Policy Updates

Your privacy policy needs to clearly communicate how data is collected, used, and managed. Include these key points:

-   **Data Collection Scope**: Specify the categories of personal information collected.
-   **Usage Purpose**: Explain why each type of data is collected and how it’s used.
-   **Sharing Practices**: Identify any third parties receiving user data.
-   **User Rights**: Outline CCPA rights and provide clear instructions for exercising them.
-   **Contact Methods**: Offer at least two ways users can submit requests, such as email or a web form.

### User Control Features

Add in-app tools to give users control over their data:

**Privacy Toggles** for:

-   Data collection preferences
-   Marketing communications
-   Data sharing with third parties

**Consent Management**:

-   Provide clear opt-in and opt-out options.
-   Record user preferences with timestamps.
-   Allow users to update their preferences easily.

These features empower users while keeping your app compliant.

### Data Request System

Set up a system to handle user requests related to their CCPA rights. Here's a suggested framework:

| Request Type | Response Time | Verification Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data Access | 45 days | Two-factor authentication |
