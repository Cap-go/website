    if (!isAvailable) {
      return {
        success: false,
        message: "Biometric authentication not available"
      };
    }

    const result = await Biometrics.authenticate({
      reason: "Access your secure data",
      title: "Verify Identity",
      subtitle: "Use biometrics to authenticate",
      cancelTitle: "Use Password Instead"
    });

    return {
      success: true,
      data: result
    };
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      success: false,
      error: error.message
    };
  }
}
```

For managing secure credentials, the **capacitor-native-biometric** plugin offers a straightforward approach:

```typescript
import { NativeBiometric } from '@capgo/capacitor-native-biometric';

async function secureCredentialStorage(credentials) {
  try {
    await NativeBiometric.setCredentials({
      username: credentials.username,
      password: credentials.password,
      server: "api.yourserver.com"
    });

    // Verify storage by retrieving the credentials
    const stored = await NativeBiometric.getCredentials({
      server: "api.yourserver.com"
    });

    return stored.username === credentials.username;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Credential storage failed:", error);
    return false;
  }
}
```

Once the code is in place, itâ€™s crucial to validate its functionality through proper testing.

### Testing Methods

To ensure your biometric authentication is reliable and secure, consider these testing strategies:

-   **Device Compatibility Testing**
    
    Check if the authentication works across various devices and conditions:
    
    ```typescript
    async function runCompatibilityTests() {
      const tests = {
        biometricAvailable: await Biometrics.isBiometricsAvailable(),
        credentialStorage: await testCredentialStorage(),
        authenticationFlow: await testAuthFlow(),
        fallbackMechanism: await testFallbackAuth()
      };
    
      return tests;
    }
    ```
    
-   **Error Handling and Common Scenarios**
    
    Simulate errors and test fallback mechanisms:
    
    ```typescript
    async function validateErrorHandling() {
      try {
        await Promise.race([
          Biometrics.authenticate(),
          new Promise((_, reject) =>
            setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Timeout")), 30000)
          )
        ]);
      } catch (error) {
        return implementFallbackAuth();
      }
    }
    ```
    
-   **Security Validation**
    
    Ensure your implementation meets security standards:
    
    ```typescript
    async function validateSecurityMeasures() {
      const validations = {
        keychain: await validateKeychainAccess(),
        biometricStrength: await checkBiometricStrength(),
        encryptionStatus: await verifyEncryption()
      };
    
      return validations.keychain &&
             validations.biometricStrength &&
             validations.encryptionStatus;
    }
    ```
    

Additionally, test for scenarios like:

-   Multiple failed authentication attempts
-   Behavior after device restarts
-   Transitions between foreground and background app states
-   Changes in network connectivity
-   Updates to system biometric settings

Thorough testing ensures the biometric authentication system is robust and ready for real-world use.

## Security Standards

Ensuring strong security in biometric authentication means prioritizing data protection, adhering to compliance regulations, and applying layered security techniques.

### Data Security Methods

On iOS, biometric data is encrypted and stored using **Keychain**, while Android uses the **Keystore**. If you're using the `capacitor-native-biometric` plugin, you can securely store user credentials like this:

```typescript
import { NativeBiometric } from '@capgo/capacitor-native-biometric';

async function securelyStoreCredentials(username, password) {
  const server = "api.yourapp.com";

  // Use the highest available encryption
  await NativeBiometric.setCredentials({
    username,
    password,
    server,
    authenticationType: "biometricAndDevice",
    accessControl: "biometryAny"
  });
}
```

For data transmission, always implement **end-to-end encryption** to keep sensitive information protected.

### Store Guidelines

App stores enforce strict rules for [biometric security](https://capgo.app/plugins/capacitor-native-biometric/). Here's a breakdown of the major platform requirements:

| Platform | Key Requirements | Implementation Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iOS | Use the LocalAuthentication framework, provide fallback options, and ensure clear user consent | Must support both Face ID and Touch ID |
| Android | Leverage the BiometricPrompt API, obtain explicit user permission, and declare security levels | Support fingerprint and facial recognition, with distinctions for varying security levels |

### Multi-Factor Setup

Enhancing security often requires combining [biometric verification](https://capgo.app/plugins/capacitor-native-biometric/) with an additional layer of authentication. For example, after initial [biometric verification](https://capgo.app/plugins/capacitor-native-biometric/), you can add a secondary step to confirm the userâ€™s identity:

```typescript
async function setupMultiFactorAuth() {
  // First factor: Biometric verification
  const biometricResult = await Biometrics.authenticate({
    reason: "Verify your identity",
    title: "Authentication Required"
  });

  if (biometricResult.verified) {
    // Second factor: Time-based OTP or similar mechanism
    const totpResult = await verifyTOTP();
    return totpResult.success;
  }

  return false;
}
```

A multi-factor approach typically includes:

-   **Primary biometric authentication**
-   **Secondary verification** (e.g., SMS code or an authenticator app)
-   **Transaction-specific confirmation** for added security

If you're using tools like Capgo for live updates, ensure compliance with security standards by taking advantage of its **end-to-end encryption** features. This guarantees that your biometric authentication methods stay secure during updates and align with platform requirements [\[1\]](https://capacitor-tutorial.com/plugins/capacitor-biometric-auth/).

## Maintenance Guide

Keep your biometric system running smoothly by balancing speed, battery efficiency, and timely updates.

### Speed and Battery Tips

Hereâ€™s a code snippet for implementing efficient biometric authentication:

```typescript
// Efficient authentication implementation
async function optimizedBiometricCheck() {
  const authResult = await NativeBiometric.isAvailable();

  if (!authResult.isAvailable) {
    return handleFallback();
  }

  // Cache authentication state to avoid unnecessary re-checks
  if (this.cachedAuthState && !this.isAuthExpired()) {
    return this.cachedAuthState;
  }

  return NativeBiometric.verifyIdentity({
    reason: "Verify your identity",
    title: "Authentication Required",
    maxAttempts: 3
  });
}
```

To make the most of your biometric systemâ€™s performance:

-   **Batch Authentication**: Instead of multiple prompts, group actions requiring authentication into one session to reduce interruptions.
-   **Smart Caching**: Save authentication states securely and set expiration times to avoid redundant verifications.
-   **Background Optimization**: Temporarily pause nonessential tasks during authentication to improve speed and save battery.
-   **Event-Driven Approach**: Replace constant polling with event listeners to monitor authentication status more efficiently.
