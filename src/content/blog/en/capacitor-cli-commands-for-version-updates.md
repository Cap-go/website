## Before You Update

Taking the time to prepare before updating can save you from headaches later. A bit of groundwork helps avoid common pitfalls and ensures everything runs smoothly. Here's what you need to focus on to minimize risks during the [update process](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/manual-update/).

### Check System Requirements

First things first - make sure your development setup meets the requirements for Capacitor. Versions 6 and 7 have specific software needs [\[1\]](https://capgo.app).

Hereâ€™s what you should verify:

-   **Node.js**: Check that your Node.js version is compatible.
-   **Platform-Specific Tools**:
    -   For iOS development, ensure you have the latest version of Xcode installed.
    -   For Android, confirm that [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) is up to date.

### Read Update Notes

Update notes are your roadmap for understanding how the changes might affect your project. Take the time to review the following:

-   **Official Documentation**: Look through Capacitor's changelog and migration guides.
-   **Breaking Changes**: Pay close attention to any sections labeled "Breaking Changes." These often highlight crucial updates that could disrupt your workflow.
-   **Plugin Compatibility**: Double-check that all the Capacitor plugins in your project are supported by the new version.

## CLI Update Commands

These commands help you update your app while ensuring everything continues to work smoothly.

### Update Capacitor CLI

To get access to the latest features, update your Capacitor CLI. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install -g @capacitor/cli@latest
```

Once installed, confirm the update by checking your CLI version:

```bash
npx cap --version
```

### Run Migration Commands

In your project directory, execute the following commands to update core and platform-specific Capacitor packages:

```bash
# Update core Capacitor packages
npm install @capacitor/core@latest
npm install @capacitor/cli@latest

# Update platform-specific packages
npm install @capacitor/ios@latest
npm install @capacitor/android@latest

# Run the migration command
npx cap migrate
```

The `npx cap migrate` command will:

-   Update your app's configurations
-   Sync dependencies
-   Apply necessary project changes
-   Validate plugins for compatibility

If some updates aren't handled automatically, you may need to complete them manually.

### Complete Manual Steps

To sync your project with the updated platforms, run:

```bash
npx cap sync
```

For additional automation, you can integrate Capgo's CLI tool by running:

```bash
npx @capgo/cli init
```

Finally, verify the update by building your app for each platform:

```bash
# For iOS
npx cap open ios

# For Android
npx cap open android
```

If you face issues during the update, the CLI will provide detailed error messages to help with troubleshooting. Be sure to review the build output for any warnings or errors that may need your attention.

## Platform Updates

With the core updates wrapped up, the next step is fine-tuning the platform configurations for iOS and Android projects.

### iOS Update Steps

To get started with your iOS project, open it in Xcode and follow these steps:

-   **Update CocoaPods Dependencies**  
    Begin by refreshing your dependencies using CocoaPods. Navigate to your iOS project directory and run the following command:
    
    ```bash
    cd ios/App
    pod install
    ```
    
-   **Configure Xcode Settings**  
    Make sure these Xcode settings are updated to ensure smooth operation and compliance:
    
    | **Setting** | **Action Required** | **Purpose** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Deployment Target | Set a minimum iOS version | Ensure compatibility |
    | Build Settings | Update signing identity | Meet App Store requirements |
    | Asset Catalog | Verify icon and splash assets | Maintain visual consistency |
    
-   **Clean Build**  
    Clear out cached files and perform a clean build to avoid any leftover issues:
    
    ```bash
    # Clean the build folder
    xcodebuild clean
    # Build the project
    xcodebuild build
    ```
    

Once the iOS updates are complete, you can shift your attention to the Android project.

### Android Update Steps

For Android, open the project in Android Studio and follow these steps:

-   **Update Gradle Configuration**  
    Open your `build.gradle` file and confirm these settings are correctly configured:
    
    ```kotlin
    android {
        compileSdkVersion 33
        defaultConfig {
            minSdkVersion 22
            targetSdkVersion 33
        }
    }
    ```
    
-   **Sync Project Files**  
    Sync the project with Gradle files to ensure all dependencies are up to date. This step may also involve updating SDK tools and resolving any conflicts.
    
-   **Verify Java Version**  
    Check that you're using the correct version of Java, as this is critical for compatibility with Gradle and Android features:
    
    ```bash
    # Check the current Java version
    ./gradlew --version
    ```
    

Make sure to pay close attention to your Gradle configuration. Some updates might require a newer Gradle version to support the latest Android features effectively.

## Fix Common Problems

[Capacitor updates](https://capgo.app/plugins/capacitor-updater/) can sometimes lead to issues that disrupt your app's stability. Here's how you can address these common problems effectively.

### Fix Package Conflicts

Start by checking for version mismatches in your Capacitor packages. Use the following command:

```bash
npm ls @capacitor/core
```

Review the output and ensure that the versions of **@capacitor/core**, **@capacitor/ios**, and **@capacitor/android** are consistent in your `package.json` file. If you spot any conflicts, update or remove problematic packages to stabilize your environment.

After resolving these, double-check that all installed plugins are compatible with the updated Capacitor version.

### Check Plugin Support

Before updating, make sure your plugins are ready to work with the latest Capacitor version. Use these commands to manage and verify plugin compatibility:

| **Action** | **Command** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| List Plugins | `npx cap ls` | Displays all installed plugins |
| Check Versions | `npm outdated` | Identifies outdated plugins |
| Update Plugins | `npm update` | Updates plugins to compatible versions |

If you're using live update tools like **Capgo**, confirm that your plugins support dynamic updates. This helps prevent runtime conflicts and ensures smoother performance.

### Solve Build Errors

Build errors can vary depending on the platform, but here are platform-specific fixes:

**For iOS:**

Clean out your build folders using this command:

```bash
xcodebuild clean -workspace ios/App/App.xcworkspace -scheme App
```

**For Android:**

Clear the Gradle cache by running:

```bash
cd android && ./gradlew clean
```

If errors persist after cleaning, you may need to re-add the affected platforms. Hereâ€™s how:

```bash
npx cap rm ios
npx cap rm android
npx cap add ios
npx cap add android
```

Finally, if you're using Capgo for live updates, double-check that your build configurations meet the platform's requirements to avoid further issues.

### How can I check if my plugins are compatible with the latest version of Capacitor before updating?

Before making the leap to the latest version of Capacitor, it's crucial to double-check that your plugins are ready to handle the update. Start by digging into the plugin's documentation or repository to see if there are any version-specific requirements or updates. Most plugins clearly indicate which Capacitor versions they support, so this step can save you from unnecessary headaches.

You can also test your app in a controlled environment with the updated Capacitor version. This lets you spot and fix any compatibility problems before the update goes live in production. Tools like **Capgo** can be a lifesaver here, allowing you to push updates directly without needing app store approvals. This means you can quickly address plugin-related issues while staying within platform guidelines.
