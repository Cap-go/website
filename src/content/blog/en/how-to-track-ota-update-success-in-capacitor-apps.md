OTA updates let you push app changes directly to users without waiting for app store approval. But tracking their success is critical to ensure smooth updates, fix issues quickly, and improve user experience. Here's what you need to know:

-   **Why Track Updates?**
    
    -   Detect failures early
        
    -   Monitor user adoption rates
        
    -   Roll back problematic updates
        
    -   Avoid version mismatches
        
-   **Key Steps to Track OTA Updates:**
    
    1.  **Version Management:** Use channels like Production, Beta, and Staged Rollouts for controlled updates.
        
    2.  **In-App Tracking:** Set up event listeners and log installation progress using tools like `@capgo/capacitor-updater`.
        
    3.  **Server Logging:** Track metrics like update success rates, device conditions, and user engagement.
        
-   **Measuring Success:**
    
    -   Track user update rates (95% adoption within 24 hours is ideal).
        
    -   Identify problem areas by analyzing device types, network conditions, and regional trends.
        
-   **Tools to Use:**
    
    -   Real-time analytics
        
    -   Error monitoring
        
    -   Rollback options

**Setting Up Update Tracking**

Tracking OTA updates effectively requires clear version management and robust monitoring. Here's how to get everything in place.

### Update Version Management

Managing versions is a key part of OTA update tracking. Capgo's channel system offers a structured way to handle different versions across your users.

| Channel Type | Purpose | Best Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Production | Main release channel | Stable, tested updates |
| Beta | Testing channel | Early feature validation |
| Staged | Gradual rollout | Risk mitigation |
| Development | Internal testing | Pre-release verification |

For each version, make sure you include:

-   A unique version identifier
    
-   Detailed release notes
    
-   Specific target audience
    
-   Rollback checkpoint for safety
    

Once channels are defined, configure your app to log update events for better tracking.

### App-Side Tracking Setup

To track updates within your app, follow these steps:

1.  **Install the required dependencies**  
    Use the following command to add the necessary library:
    
    ```bash
    npm install @capgo/capacitor-updater
    ```
    
2.  **Set up event listeners**  
    Configure listeners to detect updates:
    
    ```javascript
    CapacitorUpdater.addListener('updateAvailable', () => { … });
    ```
    
3.  **Log installation progress**  
    Track when updates are downloaded and installed:
    
    ```javascript
    CapacitorUpdater.addListener('downloadComplete', () => { … });
    ```
    

After setting up in-app tracking, expand your monitoring with server-side logging for a complete picture.

### Server Logging Setup

Server logging helps you collect critical data about updates, including their impact on users and devices. Here's what to focus on:

1.  **System Metrics**
    
    -   Track update timestamps and success/failure rates
        
    -   Monitor device and network conditions
        
    -   Measure download speeds and installation times
        
    -   Assess memory usage and battery consumption
        
2.  **User Impact**
    
    -   Analyze user engagement after updates
        
    -   Check feature adoption rates
        
    -   Monitor app stability
        
    -   Observe changes in session duration

Combining version management, in-app tracking, and server logging gives you a comprehensive view of your OTA update performance.

## Measuring Update Success

Tracking the success of OTA updates involves analyzing key metrics and how users adopt them. Here’s how you can measure and evaluate update performance effectively.

### User Update Rates

Understanding how quickly users adopt updates gives insight into the effectiveness of your OTA deployment. Pay attention to the percentage of users updating within the first 24 hours to set a baseline for performance.

To monitor user update rates:

-   Keep an eye on real-time adoption percentages for each update.
    
-   Set target completion times and track update rates for different devices to identify trends.
    

Once you have this data, focus on spotting and addressing problem areas to improve your [update process](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/manual-update/).

### Problem Areas Detection

Catching issues early is critical to ensuring updates run smoothly. Focus on these areas for monitoring:

| **Monitoring Area** | **Key Metrics** | **Action Items** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Device Types | Success rates by model | Fix issues on underperforming devices |
| Network Conditions | Download completion rates | Adjust update size for slower connections |
| Geographic Regions | Regional success rates | Resolve location-specific challenges |
| App Versions | Version distribution | Identify and address stuck updates |

By examining these metrics, you can pinpoint where updates may be failing and take corrective actions.

### Analytics Tools Overview

After identifying potential issues, use analytics tools to gain deeper insights. Look for tools that provide real-time data, error tracking, and user engagement metrics to:

-   Monitor updates across your user base and respond quickly to problems.
    
-   Log errors to pinpoint and resolve specific failure points.
    
-   Analyze how updates influence user behavior and app performance.
    

These steps will help ensure your OTA updates are both smooth and effective.

## Update Impact Analysis

### Performance Metrics

To evaluate the impact of an update, compare key performance indicators before and after implementation:

-   **Startup Speed**: Aim for a startup time under 2 seconds (specific benchmarks may vary).
    
-   **API Response Time**: Keep server communication under 434 ms.
    
-   **Crash Rates**: Ensure app stability with a target crash rate below 1%.
    
-   **Memory Usage**: Measure resource consumption against your baseline.
    
-   **Network Usage**: Optimize data transfer and minimize update sizes.
    

Keep a close eye on these metrics for at least 48 hours after the update to spot any improvements or potential issues.

### User Behavior Changes

Understand how the update affects user interaction by analyzing:

-   **Feature Adoption Rate**: Measure how quickly users engage with new features.
    
-   **Session Duration & Retention**: Track engagement trends using metrics like DAU (Daily Active Users) and MAU (Monthly Active Users).
    
-   **Navigation Patterns**: Examine how user flows change after the update.
    

Use these insights to fine-tune your app and address any emerging concerns.

Capgo also supports staged testing by targeting specific user groups before a full rollout. This approach ensures consistent performance and minimizes risks across your entire user base.

## Update Problem Solving

### Common Update Problems

Updates can hit snags like network failures, version mismatches, outdated cache files, or incomplete installations. Here's a quick breakdown:

| Problem | Common Cause | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Failed Downloads | Poor network connection | Use an automatic retry system with exponential backoff. |
| Version Conflicts | Incompatible dependencies | Enforce strict version checks before deploying updates. |
| Cache Issues | Outdated cache files | Add cache-busting techniques and clear old versions. |
| Partial Updates | Interrupted installation | Use [atomic updates](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/hybrid-update/) with a rollback option to ensure consistency. |

### Error Tracking Setup

Effective tracking is key to identifying and resolving update problems. Focus on these areas:

-   **Update download status**: Monitor success rates and completion times.
    
-   **Installation progress**: Track each step of the installation process.
    
-   **Post-update functionality**: Confirm that essential app features work properly after the update.
    

To set this up:

1.  **Real-time monitoring**: Configure automated alerts for critical failures and set error thresholds for immediate notifications.
    
2.  **Detailed logging**: Record update versions, device specs, network conditions, installation times, and error traces.
    
3.  **User feedback**: Allow users to report any issues with updates directly.
    

If errors continue despite these measures, initiate rollback procedures to minimize disruptions.

### Update Rollback Steps

A well-planned rollback process can help reduce user frustration when updates go wrong. Here's how to prepare:

1.  **Define rollback triggers**: Set automated thresholds that activate rollback processes when specific issues arise.
    
2.  **Use version control**: Always keep multiple update versions ready for a quick rollback.
