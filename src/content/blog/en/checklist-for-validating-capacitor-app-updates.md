**Want to deliver [smooth app updates](https://capgo.app/plugins/capacitor-updater/) without risking user trust?** Here’s a quick, actionable checklist for validating [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) app updates, especially when using over-the-air (OTA) updates:

-   **Test Features**: Ensure all workflows (like login, data sync) function end-to-end.
-   **Device Coverage**: Test on various devices, operating systems, and screen sizes.
-   **Performance Checks**: Measure speed, responsiveness, and memory usage under different conditions.
-   **Security**: Encrypt OTA updates, assign permissions, and test rollback features.
-   **Distribution**: Use tools like [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) to ensure 95% of users get updates within 24 hours.
-   **Post-Release Monitoring**: Track success rates (aim for 82%), API response times, and user engagement.

## Pre-Validation Setup

After migration, set up dedicated environments for each platform to ensure smooth and consistent validation.

### Testing Environment Setup

Prepare separate testing environments for iOS, Android, and web platforms, following Capacitor's official guidelines [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/). Secure your codebase by implementing strict version control practices.

### Version Control Setup

Set up your repository with the following practices:

-   Use feature branches to isolate new updates.
-   Integrate with CI/CD systems like [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions) or [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) for automated builds.
-   Leverage Capgo's one-click rollback feature for quick reversion when needed [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

### [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) Setup

Configure Capgo with these steps [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/):

-   [Initialize Capgo](https://capgo.app/docs/webapp/) using: `npx @capgo/cli init`.
-   Set up a [channel system](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/channel-system/) to target specific updates.
-   Enable end-to-end encryption for added security.
-   Turn on error tracking and analytics.
-   Configure rollback options for better control.
-   Choose between cloud or [self-hosted deployment](https://capgo.app/blog/self-hosted-capgo/), based on your needs.

For enterprise use, Capgo offers compatibility with Capacitor 6 and 7, and supports both cloud and self-hosted deployments [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/). Once this setup is complete, move on to feature and device testing.

## Main Testing Checklist

Once your environments and [Capgo setup](https://capgo.app/docs/cli/commands) are ready, focus on these key validations:

### Feature Testing

-   Ensure primary user workflows (like login, data sync, and navigation) function end-to-end.
-   Confirm that new features meet their defined acceptance criteria.
-   Use [Capgo analytics](https://capgo.app/consulting/) to track errors and aim for at least an 82% success rate [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

### Device Testing

-   Test on both the minimum and latest operating systems for iOS and Android.
-   Check functionality on various screen sizes.
-   Evaluate performance on both low-end and high-end devices.
-   Verify how the app behaves offline and ensure data is retained properly.

### Speed and Reliability Testing

-   Measure how quickly the app launches and how responsive features are.
-   Test performance under different network conditions.
-   Check the behavior of background processes.
-   Monitor memory usage and battery impact.

### Security Testing

-   Ensure OTA payloads are encrypted and can only be decrypted by authorized builds.
-   Assign specific update permissions to testers and beta users.
-   Verify compliance with Apple and Google platform security requirements.
-   Test the one-click rollback feature and ensure the rollback process works smoothly.

### OTA & Distribution Testing

-   Use [Capgo channels](https://capgo.app/docs/webapp/channels/) to roll out updates in stages or to beta groups.
-   Confirm that at least 95% of active users receive updates within 24 hours [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).
-   Segment users by channel and ensure each segment gets the correct version.
-   Track real-time metrics to monitor update success and user engagement.

## Final Steps

After completing the main testing phase, focus on validation, documentation, staged rollouts, and ongoing monitoring.

### Recording Test Results

Once the primary tests are done, document the results using your analytics platform. Leverage the dashboard you set up during the Pre-Validation phase to track key metrics through Capgo's analytics tools.

Make sure to log any errors and their resolutions to streamline future updates.

### Beta Testing Process

Introduce updates gradually using beta channels [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/):

-   **Initial Beta Group**: Start with a small group of internal testers.
-   **Expanded Testing**: Broaden the beta to include larger groups.
-   **Monitoring Phase**: Keep an eye on metrics and gather user feedback.
-   **Issue Resolution**: Address any problems before the full release.

Ensure beta builds are tested on critical devices to avoid compatibility issues during the official launch.

> "Analytics and error tracking" are important for updates. – Capgo [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

### Post-Release Monitoring

Keep track of these critical metrics after deployment:

-   **Success Rate**: Aim for at least 82% (via Capgo Analytics).
-   **Distribution**: Ensure 95% coverage within 24 hours (using Real-time Tracking).
-   **API Response Time**: Maintain responses at or below 434 ms (via Performance Monitor).

Set up alerts to notify your team if any metrics fall below these thresholds.
