## Secure OTA Update Infrastructure

Build a reliable OTA (Over-The-Air) update system for [Capacitor apps](https://capgo.app/blog/capacitor-comprehensive-guide/) by incorporating HTTPS, strong authentication, and real-time update tools.

### HTTPS Setup for Updates

Using HTTPS is crucial for encrypting update transmissions. Key security measures include:

| Security Component | Implementation Detail | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SSL/TLS Certificate | Obtain from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) | Secures data during transmission |
| Server Configuration | Enforce strict HTTPS usage | Protects against downgrade attacks |
| Certificate Pinning | Validate SHA-256 fingerprint | Confirms server identity |

Ensure your Capacitor app only accepts HTTPS connections for update requests. This step prevents data interception and tampering, forming the base for secure authentication.

### Update Request Authentication

TLS (Transport Layer Security) mutual authentication ensures both the client and server verify each other's identity. All HTTP communications for updates should include strict authentication and authorization checks [\[2\]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/dev-guide-ota-security.html). These protocols enhance the security provided by HTTPS, creating a layered defense.

### Using [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) for Updates

![Capgo](https://mars-images.imgix.net/seobot/screenshots/capgo.app-26aea05b7e2e737b790a9becb40f7bc5-2025-02-25.jpg?auto=compress)

Capgo offers a streamlined and secure solution for managing OTA updates. With over 23.5 million updates delivered across 750 production apps, Capgo provides:

-   **End-to-end encryption** for authorized users
-   **Compliance** with Apple and Google platform rules
-   **Real-time verification** to ensure update integrity

To get started, install the Capgo plugin using `npx @capgo/cli init`. This enables automatic verification of updates when the app starts. For iOS, Capgo includes a custom Dart interpreter to meet platform-specific requirements [\[3\]](https://capgo.app/docs/faq/).

## Cryptographic Security Methods

Secure OTA updates in Capacitor apps by implementing strong cryptographic practices.

### Key Management

Effective key management is critical. Use a Key Management Service (KMS) to handle the generation, storage, distribution, and monitoring of encryption keys.

| Key Management Phase | Implementation Requirements | Security Considerations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generation | Use a cryptographically secure TRNG | Ensure a hardware-based entropy source |
| Storage | Utilize encrypted backup systems | Maintain secure key isolation |
| Distribution | Apply access control mechanisms | Enforce role-based permissions |
| Monitoring | Enable real-time access tracking | Set up automated alerts |

For client-side key storage, rely on secure platform-specific tools like **[iOS Keychain Services](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain-services)** and **Android Keystore APIs**. Once your keys are securely stored, sign your update packages to confirm their authenticity.

### Update Package Signing

1.  **Package Preparation**
    
    Prepare the update bundle by including your production Capacitor build output, typically located in the "dist/" or "www/" directory. The package should include:
    
    -   `index.html`
    -   Bundled JavaScript files
    -   CSS resources
    -   Other necessary web assets
2.  **Signing Process**
    
    Use Capacitor's `publicKey` configuration to enable end-to-end encryption. Keep the zip file unencrypted to ensure smooth unpacking during updates.
    

### Update Verification Steps

To ensure the integrity of signed updates, follow these verification steps:

| Verification Step | Purpose | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bundle Integrity | Ensure package completeness and verify the source | Validate required files and cryptographic signatures |
| Version Control | Prevent downgrade attacks | Compare version numbers with the latest deployed version |

For added security, implement a server-side verification system to manage sensitive operations involving secret keys. This aligns with best practices and recommendations from [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/) for maintaining the integrity of update systems.

## Failed Update Management

Managing failures effectively after verifying update integrity is crucial for maintaining system reliability and user trust.

### Update Rollback Steps

Set up an automated rollback system to handle situations where integrity checks fail. Capgo's automated reversion tools can help ensure your system stays stable during such events.

| Phase | Action | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pre-rollback | Verify backup version integrity | Check cryptographic signatures |
| Execution | Restore previous working version | Confirm successful restoration |
| Post-rollback | Validate app functionality | Run critical path tests |

Here's how you can configure your [Capacitor updater](https://capgo.app/plugins/capacitor-updater/) with suitable timeout settings for smoother rollbacks:

```javascript
{
  appReadyTimeout: 10000,
  responseTimeout: 15000,
  autoDeleteFailed: true
}
```

### Error Tracking System

Capacitor's built-in event listeners are handy for tracking errors during updates. Use them to monitor and log issues effectively:

-   Monitor events like `updateFailed` and `downloadFailed`
-   Log version details and failure causes
-   Identify recurring issues by analyzing patterns

This approach helps you pinpoint problems and prepares you to communicate clearly with users during update failures.

### User Communication Guide

Keeping users informed during update failures minimizes frustration and reduces support tickets. Here's a guide for effective communication:

| Timing | Message Content | Channel |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pre-update | Scheduled maintenance notice | In-app notification |
| During failure | Status and resolution time | Status bar updates |
| Post-incident | Issue resolution confirmation | Push notification |

**Key tips for communication:**

1.  Notify users immediately with a simple explanation and an estimated resolution time.
2.  Provide ongoing updates through the system status bar.
3.  Send a final confirmation once the issue is resolved, including instructions for version verification.
