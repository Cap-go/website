Choosing between **staged rollouts** and **full releases** depends on your app’s needs, user base, and update urgency. Here’s a quick breakdown:

-   **Staged Rollouts**: Updates are released gradually to smaller user groups, allowing for controlled testing, risk management, and feedback collection.
-   **Full Releases**: Updates are deployed to all users at once, ideal for critical fixes or time-sensitive updates.

### Quick Comparison

| Aspect | Staged Rollouts | Full Releases |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Risk Level** | Low (limited exposure initially) | High (affects all users simultaneously) |
| **Deployment Speed** | Gradual over time | Instant for all users |
| **User Feedback** | Gradual collection from small groups | Immediate from all users |
| **Rollback** | Selective and quick | Universal but slower |
| **Server Load** | Balanced | High during release |
| **Use Case** | Testing new features, managing risks | Critical fixes, urgent updates |

### When to Use Each Method

-   **Staged Rollouts**: Best for [complex updates](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/hybrid-update), large user bases, or when minimizing risks is a priority.
-   **Full Releases**: Ideal for urgent bug fixes, security patches, or simple updates requiring broad adoption.

| **Instant Rollback** | Revert to previous versions | Reduce the impact of errors |

### Common Methods for Staged Rollouts

These features are applied through two main approaches:

-   **Percentage-based deployment**: Start with a small percentage of users and gradually increase the rollout based on performance data.
-   **Channel-based distribution**: Divide users into channels, like beta or production, to test updates and gather feedback before broader release.

### Pros and Cons of Staged Rollouts

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- |
| Detect bugs early | Slower overall rollout |
| Manage risks effectively | More complex to oversee |
| Get specific user feedback | Multiple versions may confuse users |

## Direct Comparison: Staged vs Full Releases

Here's a closer look at how staged rollouts compare to full releases, focusing on factors that directly influence app performance and user experience.

| Aspect | Staged Rollouts | Full Releases |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Risk Level | Lower – limited exposure to a subset of users initially | Higher – update pushed to all users at once |
| Deployment Speed | 24 hours for 95% user coverage [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/) | Instant for the entire user base |
| Update Success Rate | 82% global success rate [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/) | Depends heavily on infrastructure capabilities |
| Cost Efficiency | More economical over time | Lower upfront costs but higher costs for fixes if issues arise |
| User Feedback Loop | Gradual feedback collection | Immediate feedback from all users |
| Rollback Capability | Instant, selective rollback available [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/) | Affects all users if rolled back |
| Resource Requirements | Balanced server load | Risk of infrastructure overload |
| Version Management | Multiple versions can coexist | Single version deployed universally |

Each approach has its own set of trade-offs when it comes to speed, cost, and risk. For example, staged rollouts allow for selective rollbacks and gradual feedback gathering, making them a safer option for testing updates. Full releases, on the other hand, are faster but require solid infrastructure and rigorous pre-release testing to avoid widespread issues.

The main distinction lies in _risk management_. Staged rollouts give developers the ability to monitor performance on a smaller scale before expanding to the full user base. Full releases, while faster, demand significant preparation to handle potential challenges across all users.
