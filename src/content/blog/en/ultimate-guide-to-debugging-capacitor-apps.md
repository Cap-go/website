## Core Debugging Tools

Debugging [Capacitor apps](https://capgo.app/blog/capacitor-comprehensive-guide/) effectively requires the right tools. Here’s a breakdown of the essential [debugging resources](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/debugging/) every Capacitor developer should know.

### Web Debugging with Browser Tools

For debugging the web layer of Capacitor apps, **Chrome DevTools** and **Safari Web Inspector** are must-haves. These tools allow you to:

-   **Network Panel**: Track API calls, resource loading, and network performance.
-   **Console**: Catch JavaScript errors, view logs, and debug output.
-   **Elements Inspector**: Inspect and modify DOM elements on the fly.
-   **Sources Panel**: Set breakpoints and debug JavaScript execution.

Make sure to enable source maps - this lets you debug your original code instead of the minified production versions. For platform-specific issues, native debugging tools are the next step.

### iOS and Android Debug Tools

When working on platform-specific problems, native debugging tools provide deeper insights into app behavior.

**[Xcode Debugging Tools](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/debugging/)** (for iOS):

-   Monitor memory usage.
-   Profile CPU performance.
-   Inspect network activity.
-   Access device logs via the Console app.

**Android Studio Tools** (for Android):

-   Use **Logcat** for system logs.
-   Analyze UI with the **Layout Inspector**.
-   Profile performance with the **CPU Profiler**.
-   Track memory usage with the **Memory Profiler**.

These tools complement browser-based debugging by addressing platform-specific challenges.

### [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) CLI Debug Commands

![Capacitor](https://mars-images.imgix.net/seobot/screenshots/capacitorjs.com-4c1a6a7e452082d30f5bff9840b00b7d-2025-03-18.jpg?auto=compress)

The Capacitor CLI includes helpful commands to streamline debugging:

```bash
npx cap doctor           # Check your environment setup
npx cap sync             # Sync web code with native projects
npx cap open ios         # Open iOS project in Xcode
npx cap open android     # Open Android project in Android Studio
```

For live reload during development, use:

```bash
ionic cap run ios -l --external       # Live reload for iOS
ionic cap run android -l --external   # Live reload for Android
```

To troubleshoot plugin issues, enable verbose logging:

```bash
npx cap run ios --verbose
```

This outputs detailed logs about plugin initialization and native bridge communication, helping you pinpoint integration issues between web and native code.

## Web and Native Debug Methods

### Web Code Debugging Steps

To troubleshoot web components, leverage browser developer tools. These tools let you inspect elements, log messages to the console, monitor performance, and track network requests to pinpoint problems. Use source maps to trace errors back to the original code. If the issue involves native components, switch to [debugging methods](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/debugging/) tailored to the platform.

### Native Code Debug Steps

For iOS, rely on Xcode's [LLDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLDB_\(debugger\)) debugger. Set breakpoints in your Swift or Objective-C code to step through execution. Use Instruments to keep an eye on memory usage and thread activity. For Android, Android Studio provides robust tools, including native logging. Here's an example:

```java
Log.d("CapacitorApp", "Debug information");
Log.e("CapacitorApp", "Error details", exception);
```

These tools also simplify debugging for plugins when integrated into your workflow.

### Plugin Debug Solutions

Verbose logging is key when debugging plugins. Pay attention to the following areas:

-   Communication between the bridge and the plugin
-   The implementation of specific methods
-   How errors are propagated

Capgo's error tracking tools can catch plugin problems early, preventing them from affecting users. You can also set up automated error reporting with code like this:

```javascript
window.addEventListener('error', (event) => {
    console.error('Plugin Error:', {
      message: event.message,
      filename: event.filename,
      lineNo: event.lineno
    });
});
```

This approach ensures you catch and address issues efficiently.

## Complex Debug Scenarios

### App Launch Issues

Launch issues often happen before standard logging kicks in, making them tricky to diagnose. Here's a step-by-step approach to handle them:

-   **Check Native Logs**: Use platform-specific tools like Xcode Console for iOS or Android Studio's Logcat to uncover initialization errors. These logs often hold the first clues about what went wrong.
    
-   **Track Plugin Errors**: Monitor plugin loading problems with a simple listener. Here's an example snippet:
    
    ```javascript
    App.addListener('pluginError', (info) => {
        console.error('Plugin failed to load:', info.pluginId);
        console.error('Error:', info.errorMessage);
    });
    ```
    
-   **Inspect Resource Loading**: Use browser developer tools to verify if essential resources are loading properly. Look for blocked requests or slow-loading assets and review timing metrics.
    

Once these initial checks are complete, you can move on to platform-specific debugging methods.

### Platform-Specific Issues

Some bugs are tied to specific platforms, requiring tailored troubleshooting techniques.

For **iOS debugging**:

-   Use **Xcode's Memory Graph Debugger** to spot memory leaks.
-   Test different network conditions with **Network Link Conditioner**.
-   Add device-specific logging to catch iOS-specific crashes.

For **Android debugging**:

-   Leverage **Android Studio's CPU Profiler** to analyze performance.
-   Enable **strict mode** to flag disk or network operations running on the main thread.

### Performance Issues

After resolving launch and platform-specific problems, turn your attention to performance. Tackling performance issues involves focusing on three key areas: network, memory, and UI.

-   **Network Performance**: Use Chrome DevTools to identify slow API responses or oversized payloads.
-   **Memory Management**: Spot leaks with native profilers to ensure efficient memory usage.
-   **UI Optimization**: Monitor frame rates and animations using built-in tools to ensure smooth user interactions.

Capgo's error tracking tools make it easier to pinpoint these bottlenecks early. They also allow you to roll out fixes quickly, bypassing app store review delays \[3\].

## Debug Guidelines

Effective debugging of a Capacitor app relies on well-structured logging, error monitoring, and source map management.

### Setting Up App Logs

To debug effectively, use structured logs with defined levels to avoid unnecessary noise.

```javascript
const logLevels = { ERROR: 0, WARN: 1, INFO: 2, DEBUG: 3 };

function logMessage(level, message, data = null) {
    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
    const logData = { timestamp, level, message, data };

    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
        console.log(JSON.stringify(logData));
    }
}
```

In production, implement log rotation to prevent logs from growing uncontrollably:

```javascript
const MAX_LOG_SIZE = 1024 * 1024; // 1MB
const MAX_LOG_FILES = 5;

function rotateLogFiles() {
    // Rotate logs to maintain up to 5 files of 1MB each
}
```

Besides logging, having a system to monitor errors in real time is essential.

### Error Monitoring Setup

Set up a unified error tracking system that captures issues across both client and native layers.

```javascript
window.onerror = function(message, source, lineno, colno, error) {
    logMessage(logLevels.ERROR, {
        message,
        source,
        line: lineno,
        column: colno,
        stack: error?.stack
    });

    // Send error details to monitoring service
    return false;
};
```

Capgo's error tracking tools can help monitor update deployments and assess their impact on users [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/). This integration provides crucial insights into update performance and user engagement.

Source maps are another important tool to simplify debugging, especially for minified code.

### Source Map Integration

Ensure your build process generates and manages source maps properly:

```javascript
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
    devtool: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
        ? 'hidden-source-map' 
        : 'eval-source-map',
    // ... other configuration settings
};
```

To make debugging even easier, automate source map uploads during deployment:

```javascript
const uploadSourceMaps = async (buildId) => {
    const sourceMapFiles = await glob('dist/**/*.map');

    for (const file of sourceMapFiles) {
        await uploadToDebugServer({
            buildId,
            file,
            version: process.env.APP_VERSION
        });
    }
};
```

If you use source maps in production, restrict access to authorized developers to maintain security while still allowing effective debugging.
