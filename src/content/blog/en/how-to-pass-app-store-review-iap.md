Getting your app approved on the App Store and Google Play can be challenging, especially when implementing in-app purchases (IAP) and subscriptions. With stricter guidelines in 2025, understanding what reviewers look for is crucial. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to pass review on your first submission.

## Why Apps with IAP Get Rejected

Apps with in-app purchases face higher scrutiny because they involve real money transactions. According to [Apple's App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#in-app-purchase) and [Google Play's monetization policies](https://play.google.com/about/monetization-ads/), the top rejection reasons in 2025 are:

1. **Unclear pricing** (42% of rejections)
2. **Missing or confusing subscription terms** (31%)
3. **Deceptive UI patterns** (18%)
4. **Privacy policy violations** (9%)

Let's dive into how to avoid each of these pitfalls.

## iOS App Store Requirements

> ðŸ“– **Comprehensive iOS Guide:** For complete setup instructions, see our [iOS App Store Review Guide](/docs/plugins/native-purchases/ios-app-store-review/)

### 1. Crystal-Clear Pricing Transparency

Apple requires exact pricing disclosure **before** the purchase button. This is non-negotiable.

**What Apple Wants to See:**
- Price clearly displayed: "$9.99/month"
- Billing frequency stated upfront
- What users get for their money
- When charges occur
- Cancellation instructions visible

![UI Design Best Practices](/native-purchases/review-guides/ui-design-dos-donts.webp)

**Common Mistake:**
Hiding price until users tap "Subscribe" or showing price only in fine print.

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Example: Compliant subscription display
<div className="subscription-card">
  <h2>Premium Plan</h2>
  <p className="price">$9.99/month</p>
  <ul>
    <li>âœ“ Ad-free experience</li>
    <li>âœ“ Unlimited cloud storage</li>
    <li>âœ“ Priority support</li>
  </ul>
  <p className="terms">
    Renews automatically. Cancel anytime in Settings.
  </p>
  <button>Subscribe Now</button>
</div>
```

**Price Consistency Rule:**
All prices must match across:
- App Store listing
- In-app purchase screens
- Subscription management
- Marketing materials

Even a $1 discrepancy triggers automatic rejection.

### 2. Subscription Plan Presentation

Apple flags apps that use "dark patterns" to push expensive tiers.

**Required:**
- Display all subscription tiers equally
- No pre-selected premium options
- Clear feature comparison
- Easy-to-find cheaper alternatives

**Forbidden:**
- Auto-defaulting to annual plans
- Hiding monthly options behind extra taps
- Using countdown timers to create false urgency
- Fake scarcity ("Only 3 spots left!")

### 3. Restore Purchases Functionality

Every app with IAP must provide a restore purchases button that works without requiring support contact. Learn more in our [Getting Started Guide](/docs/plugins/native-purchases/getting-started/).

**Implementation:**
```typescript
import { NativePurchases } from '@capgo/native-purchases';

async function restorePurchases() {
  try {
    const { customerInfo } = await NativePurchases.restorePurchases();

    if (customerInfo.activeSubscriptions.length > 0) {
      showSuccess('Purchases restored!');
      unlockPremiumFeatures();
    } else {
      showInfo('No previous purchases found.');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    showError('Restore failed. Please try again.');
  }
}
```

### 4. Privacy Compliance (Section 5.1.1)

2025 brings stricter privacy enforcement. Apple now requires:

**For Every Permission:**
- Clear explanation **before** requesting
- Specific use case (not generic)
- How data is stored/shared
- Whether it's optional

**Example `Info.plist` entries:**
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Camera access lets you scan product barcodes for quick upgrades. Photos are never uploaded.</string>

<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Location shows relevant local content in your Premium subscription.</string>
```

**Inaccurate privacy labels are a top rejection reason in 2025.**

## Android Google Play Requirements

> ðŸ“– **Comprehensive Android Guide:** For complete setup instructions, see our [Android Play Store Review Guide](/docs/plugins/native-purchases/android-play-store-review/)

### 1. Mandatory Google Play Billing

For digital goods (subscriptions, in-app content), you **must** use Google Play Billing. Alternative payment methods will be rejected.

**Digital Goods (Must Use Play Billing):**
- Subscriptions to features
- In-app currency
- Digital content (ebooks, music)
- Premium unlocks

**Physical Goods (Cannot Use Play Billing):**
- Real merchandise
- Physical services
- Nonprofit donations

**Implementation with native-purchases:**

For complete Android setup, see [Android Sandbox Testing](/docs/plugins/native-purchases/android-sandbox-testing/) and [Creating Subscriptions](/docs/plugins/native-purchases/android-create-subscription/).

```typescript
import { NativePurchases } from '@capgo/native-purchases';

// Automatically uses Google Play Billing on Android
await NativePurchases.configure({
  apiKey: 'your_api_key'
});

const { products } = await NativePurchases.getProducts({
  productIdentifiers: ['premium_monthly']
});
```

### 2. Transparent Auto-Renewal

Google requires clear disclosure that subscriptions auto-renew, including:
- Renewal notification before charge
- Price reminder
- Easy cancellation access

**Compliant UI:**
```typescript
<div className="subscription-terms">
  <p>Subscription renews automatically at $9.99/month</p>
  <p>Cancel anytime in Google Play Subscriptions</p>
  <p>Next billing date: February 15, 2025</p>
  <button onClick={openManagement}>
    Manage in Google Play
  </button>
</div>
```

### 3. Privacy Policy Requirements

**Mandatory for IAP apps:**
1. Privacy policy URL in Play Console
2. Privacy policy link accessible in-app
3. Accurate Data Safety section declarations

**Data Safety Must Declare:**
- Purchase history collection
- Email addresses (for receipts)
- Device IDs (fraud prevention)
- Analytics data

![App Description Guidelines](/native-purchases/review-guides/description-guidelines-1.webp)

## Common Rejection Reasons Across Both Platforms

### 1. Metadata Mismatches

**Why It Fails:**
- Screenshots show features not in current version
- Description promises functionality that doesn't exist
- Pricing differs from what's in the app

![Metadata Checklist](/native-purchases/review-guides/metadata-checklist.webp)

**Prevention:**
- Update screenshots for every submission
- Match description to actual features
- Test all claims are accurate
- Remove outdated promotional text

### 2. Misleading Marketing

**Automatic Rejection Triggers:**
- "#1 app" without proof
- "Unlimited" with hidden limits
- Fake reviews or ratings
- Competitor bashing

![Marketing Guidelines](/native-purchases/review-guides/description-guidelines-2.webp)

**Best Practice:**
Be specific and factual:
- âœ“ "Join 50,000+ users"
- âœ— "Best app in the world"
- âœ“ "Save up to 30% with annual plan"
- âœ— "Limited time offer!"

### 3. Broken Purchase Flows

**Test These Before Submission:**
- Products load correctly
- Purchase completes successfully
- Premium features unlock immediately
- Restore purchases works
- Error messages are user-friendly
- Network failures handled gracefully

```typescript
// Comprehensive error handling
async function handlePurchase(productId: string) {
  try {
    const { customerInfo } = await NativePurchases.purchaseProduct({
      productIdentifier: productId
    });

    if (customerInfo.entitlements.active['premium']) {
      unlockPremiumFeatures();
    }
  } catch (error: any) {
    switch (error.code) {
      case 'USER_CANCELLED':
        // Silent - user backed out
        break;
      case 'ITEM_ALREADY_OWNED':
        await NativePurchases.restorePurchases();
        break;
      case 'NETWORK_ERROR':
        showError('Check your connection and try again.');
        break;
      default:
        showError('Purchase failed. Please try again.');
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices for Success

### 1. Use Proper SDKs

The [@capgo/native-purchases](https://github.com/Cap-go/native-purchases) plugin handles both platforms correctly:

```typescript
// Single API for iOS and Android
await NativePurchases.configure({
  apiKey: 'your_api_key'
});

// Automatically uses correct billing system
const { products } = await NativePurchases.getProducts({
  productIdentifiers: ['premium_monthly']
});

// Platform-specific logic handled automatically
await NativePurchases.purchaseProduct({
  productIdentifier: 'premium_monthly'
});
```

### 2. Implement Proper Error Handling

Handle all purchase states gracefully:
- User cancellation (silent)
- Network errors (retry option)
- Already owned (restore)
- Product unavailable (inform user)
- Payment pending (check later)

### 3. Communicate Clearly

Users should always know:
- What they're buying
- How much it costs
- When they'll be charged
- How to cancel
- What happens after trial

### 4. Test Extensively

**iOS Sandbox:**
- Create test accounts in App Store Connect
- Configure on device (Settings > App Store > Sandbox)
- Note accelerated subscription durations

**Android License Testing:**
- Add test accounts in Play Console
- See "Test purchase" notification
- No real charges occur
