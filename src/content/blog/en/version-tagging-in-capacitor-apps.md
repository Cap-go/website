Version tagging is essential for managing [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) apps. It ensures smooth updates, tracks changes, and enhances app reliability across iOS, Android, and web platforms. Here's a quick overview:

-   **Why It Matters**: Tracks updates, enables rollbacks, and ensures stable deployments.
-   **Semantic Versioning**: Use **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** to indicate breaking changes, new features, or bug fixes.
-   **Sync Across Platforms**: Align version numbers in `package.json`, iOS `Info.plist`, and Android `build.gradle`.
-   **Automation**: [Automate updates](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/hybrid-update/) with npm scripts and CI/CD tools.
-   **Live Updates**: Tools like [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) deliver updates to 95% of users within 24 hours.
-   **Beta Management**: Use structured channels for alpha, beta, and production versions.

## Version Setup in Capacitor

Follow these steps to ensure consistent version management across all platforms in your Capacitor app.

### Setting the Version in `package.json`

The `package.json` file serves as the main source for your app's version details. Here's an example of how to set it up:

```json
{
  "name": "your-app-name",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@capacitor/core": "5.5.0",
    "@capacitor/ios": "5.5.0",
    "@capacitor/android": "5.5.0"
  }
}
```

When updating the version number, use semantic versioning (SemVer) rules:

-   **Major version** (1.x.x): Introduces breaking changes.
-   **Minor version** (x.2.x): Adds new features that are backward-compatible.
-   **Patch version** (x.x.3): Fixes bugs or makes small improvements.

### Keeping Platform Versions in Sync

It's important to align version numbers across all platforms for smooth app deployment. Each platform has its own configuration file for versioning:

| Platform | Configuration File | Version Key |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iOS | Info.plist | CFBundleShortVersionString |
| Android | build.gradle | versionName |
| Web | package.json | version |

After updating the version in `package.json`, use this command to sync the changes with native platform configurations:

```bash
npx cap sync
```

### Using Capacitor CLI for Version Management

The Capacitor CLI offers helpful commands to manage versions:

```bash
# Check the current version of Capacitor
npx cap --version

# Update Capacitor core and platform dependencies
npm install @capacitor/core@latest
npm install @capacitor/ios@latest
npm install @capacitor/android@latest

# Sync version changes to native platforms
npx cap sync
```

Keeping your Capacitor CLI updated ensures compatibility with version-specific features and reduces potential mismatches. Following these steps will help you maintain proper versioning in your app.

## Semantic Version Setup

### Semantic Version Basics

Semantic Versioning (SemVer) uses the format **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, where each part indicates a specific type of change:

| Version Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **MAJOR** | Introduces breaking changes to the API |
| **MINOR** | Adds new features that remain compatible with previous versions |
| **PATCH** | Fixes bugs or improves performance without breaking compatibility |

This system ensures developers can clearly communicate updates while preserving compatibility across app versions. For example, moving from **1.2.3** to **2.0.0** signals major, breaking updates that require careful planning.

### When to Update Version Numbers

Here's how to decide which version number to update:

| Update Type | When to Use | Version Change Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Major Update** | For breaking API changes or major UI redesigns | 1.2.3 → 2.0.0 |
| **Minor Update** | When introducing new features or marking features as deprecated | 1.2.3 → 1.3.0 |
| **Patch Update** | For bug fixes or small performance tweaks | 1.2.3 → 1.2.4 |

Now let’s look at automating these updates to simplify release management.

### Version Update Automation

[Automating version updates](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/self-hosted/auto-update/) can save time and reduce errors in your Capacitor project. Here's how to set it up:

1.  **NPM Version Scripts**

Add these scripts to your `package.json` file to manage version updates easily:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "version:patch": "npm version patch",
    "version:minor": "npm version minor",
    "version:major": "npm version major"
  }
}
```

2.  **CI/CD Integration**  
    Incorporate version updates into your CI/CD pipeline. Capgo supports tools like [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions), [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), and [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), making it simple to automate the process.

## Version Tag Methods

### Git Version Tags

Git version tags are a reliable way to keep track of [Capacitor app releases](https://capgo.app/docs/). To create clear and informative tags, combine semantic versioning with a brief description:

```bash
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release v1.2.3: Added offline mode support"
```

To maintain consistency across your team, use a standardized tagging format:

| Tag Component | Format | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Release Version | v\[MAJOR\].\[MINOR\].\[PATCH\] | v1.2.3 |
| Beta Release | v\[VERSION\]-beta.\[NUMBER\] | v1.2.3-beta.1 |
| Release Candidate | v\[VERSION\]-rc.\[NUMBER\] | v1.2.3-rc.2 |

### Build Number Integration

Build numbers help track individual builds within each version. For both iOS and Android, increment the build number with every submission:

```json
{
  "ios": {
    "version": "1.2.3",
    "build": "10234"
  },
  "android": {
    "version": "1.2.3",
    "versionCode": "10234"
  }
}
```

The build number should always increase, even if the version remains the same. This ensures each app store submission is uniquely identified while keeping the versioning clear for users.

### Beta Version Management

Managing beta versions requires a structured process to distribute test builds. Capgo’s [channel system](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/channel-system/) simplifies this with the following steps:

1.  **Channel Setup**

Create separate channels for each testing phase:

```json
{
  "beta": {
    "version": "1.3.0-beta.1",
    "users": "beta-testers"
  },
  "production": {
    "version": "1.2.3",
    "users": "all"
  }
}
```

2.  **Control User Access**

Set up permissions to control who gets access to beta versions. This ensures only approved testers receive beta builds while production users get stable releases.

3.  **Version Progression**

Use a clear version progression system to track the development stages:

| Stage | Version Format | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alpha | 1.3.0-alpha.1 | Internal testing |
| Beta | 1.3.0-beta.1 | External testing group |
| RC (Release Candidate) | 1.3.0-rc.1 | Final testing before release |
| Production | 1.3.0 | Public release |

This approach ensures thorough testing and smooth transitions between development stages, keeping version tracking organized and transparent throughout the process.

## App Version Display

Displaying accurate version information in your app is key to keeping users informed and managing updates effectively.

### Getting Version with Capacitor

You can retrieve version details using Capacitor with this code:

```typescript
import { App } from '@capacitor/app';

async function getAppInfo() {
  const info = await App.getInfo();
  console.log(`Version: ${info.version}`);
  console.log(`Build: ${info.build}`);
}
```

For a more streamlined approach, create a reusable function:

```typescript
export const getVersionString = async () => {
  const info = await App.getInfo();
  return `v${info.version} (${info.build})`;
};
```

This function simplifies the process of displaying version information in your app's interface.

### Version UI Implementation

Here's an example of how to integrate version display into a settings component:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-settings',
  template: `
    <div class="version-info">
      <span>Version: {{ versionString }}</span>
      <span *ngIf="updateAvailable" class="update-badge">
        Update Available
      </span>
    </div>
  `
})
```

Common places to show version details include:

| Location | Purpose | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Settings Screen | Full version and build | Detailed version information |
| About Page | Basic version display | Version number only |
| App Footer | Minimal display | Condensed version string |

In addition to displaying version info, integrating an update check system can improve the user experience.

### Update Check System

An update check system ensures users have access to the latest features and fixes. Capgo provides real-time notifications and controlled update channels to manage this process:

```typescript
import { CapacitorUpdater } from '@capgo/capacitor-updater';

async function checkForUpdates() {
  const current = await CapacitorUpdater.current();
  const latest = await CapacitorUpdater.getLatest();

  if (current.version !== latest.version) {
    await CapacitorUpdater.download({
      version: latest.version
    });
  }
}
```

You can also add a user-facing update notification, like this:

```typescript
@Component({
  template: `
    <update-modal 
      [version]="newVersion"
      [features]="updateFeatures"
      (updateNow)="performUpdate()"
    />
  `
})
```

For enterprise apps, Capgo's channel system allows you to control update distribution:

| Channel | Update Type | Target Audience |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Production | Stable releases | All users |
| Beta | Pre-release versions | Test group |
| Critical | Emergency fixes | Affected users |

This method ensures app reliability while tracking update performance through Capgo's analytics dashboard.
