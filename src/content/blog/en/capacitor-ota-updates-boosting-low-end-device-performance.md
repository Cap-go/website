**Want your app to run better on low-end devices? OTA updates are the answer.** [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/)'s over-the-air (OTA) updates let you push only the necessary changes to your app - no full downloads required. This saves time, reduces data usage, and improves performance, especially for users with limited hardware or slow networks.

### Key Benefits:

-   **Smaller Updates**: Only download what’s changed, not the entire app.
-   **Faster Rollouts**: Updates reach users in minutes, not days.
-   **Affordable**: [Capgo](https://capgo.app/)'s system costs ~$300/month compared to $6,000/month for alternatives.
-   **Improved Performance**: Efficient resource use ensures smoother operation on devices with low RAM, storage, or weak networks.

Capgo has already powered **947.6 million updates** across **1,400 apps**, boosting release efficiency by **81%**. Whether you’re dealing with limited storage, slow connections, or power constraints, OTA updates provide a smarter way to keep apps running smoothly.

## Performance Issues on Low-End Devices

Low-end devices face several hurdles that can affect app performance and the overall user experience. These issues stem from hardware constraints, network challenges, and power limitations.

### Hardware Limitations

Limited hardware capabilities have a direct impact on the reliability of OTA updates and device performance. Here’s a breakdown:

| Hardware Component | Constraint | Impact on Performance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RAM | Low capacity | Limited multitasking, crashes |
| Storage | Small space | Restrictions on update sizes |
| CPU | Low processing power | Sluggish performance, UI lag |

Devices with less memory are more prone to crashes, especially when running complex apps.

### Network Performance

Network challenges play a major role in slowing down or interrupting updates:

-   **Limited Bandwidth:** Many users rely on 2G or 3G networks, which are slower.
-   **Data Caps:** Small data plans limit the ability to download large updates.
-   **Unstable Connections:** Poor connectivity can interrupt and delay updates.

These network-related issues often prevent updates from completing successfully. Beyond this, power constraints add another layer of difficulty.

### Power Management

Power usage is another critical factor for low-end devices:

-   **Battery Drain:** Smaller batteries and less efficient processors cause faster drainage.
-   **Update Processes:** Running updates or syncing in the background further depletes battery life.
-   **Overheating:** Weak cooling systems can lead to overheating, causing thermal throttling and reduced performance during updates.

These power-related challenges frequently lead to failed updates. Data suggests a strong link between battery problems and update failures on low-end devices.

## Performance Benefits of OTA Updates

OTA updates tackle the challenges posed by limited hardware and network resources by offering smarter, more efficient performance improvements. For example, Capacitor's OTA updates send only the changes needed, instead of requiring users to download the entire app again. This approach reduces unnecessary data usage and speeds up the process.

### Key OTA Update Functions

One standout feature of OTA updates is **incremental (or delta) updates**. These updates focus on delivering only the modified parts of the app, which significantly cuts down on download size and time. This method is much more efficient compared to app store updates, which often require downloading the entire app package.

### OTA vs. App Store Updates

Unlike traditional app store updates, which demand a full app download, OTA updates are designed to be lean. They send only the updated portions of the app, saving users time and data. This is especially helpful for users on limited data plans or those using older devices that might struggle with large downloads.

### [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) Update System

Capgo's system is built to address the hardware and network limitations many users face. This aligns with earlier performance insights [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/). As one developer shared:

> "We rolled out Capgo OTA updates in production for our user base of +5000. We're seeing very smooth operation almost all our users are up to date within minutes of the OTA being deployed to @Capgo." - colenso [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

This real-world example shows how OTA updates can quickly and reliably deliver fixes and improvements, ensuring apps run smoothly - even on devices with limited resources.

## OTA Update Performance Methods

OTA updates play a key role in improving how low-end devices function by managing resources more efficiently. These updates focus on loading components only when needed, cutting down file sizes, and handling data more effectively.

### Component Loading Strategy

Lazy loading through OTA updates helps reduce both app size and memory usage by loading components only when required. Tools like Capgo make it possible to deploy changes instantly without the need for full app updates - especially important in areas with limited internet access. Smaller update payloads are equally critical for better performance.

### File Size Reduction

OTA updates use techniques like image compression, selective font loading, code splitting, and removing unused code. These methods help ensure updates are smaller and work better on devices with limited storage or slower bandwidth.

### Data Handling Improvements

Efficient data handling is essential for devices with fewer resources. Capgo provides tools that reduce server calls and make [local data storage](https://capgo.app/plugins/capacitor-data-storage-sqlite/) more efficient. As one developer put it:
