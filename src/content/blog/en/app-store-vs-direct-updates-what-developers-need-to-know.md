## App Store Updates Explained

App Store updates are the go-to method for delivering software updates through official platform marketplaces. This system is the main distribution channel for most mobile apps, with specific steps and guidelines developers must follow.

### How App Store Updates Work

Submitting an update to the App Store means preparing a package that meets Apple's requirements and passing a review process. Apple checks updates for security, performance, content guidelines, and functionality. Using [App Store Connect](https://developer.apple.com/app-store-connect/), developers submit their updates, which undergo thorough evaluation, including testing on supported devices, security checks, and compliance reviews.

### Benefits of App Store Updates

The App Store makes app distribution and maintenance easier. It handles tasks like update delivery, security checks, notifying users, and even payment processing. This centralized system ensures a consistent experience for users and builds trust in the platform.

### Drawbacks of App Store Updates

While convenient, the App Store system comes with some notable downsides for developers:

| Challenge | Effect on Developers |
| --- | --- |
| Review Delays | Updates may take days to go live, slowing down critical fixes |
| Limited Control | Developers depend on Apple’s schedule for urgent releases |

Other issues include Apple’s 15% commission on transactions [\[1\]](https://manytricks.com/blog/?p=4156) and restrictions from sandboxing requirements [\[2\]](https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=117780), which can limit development flexibility and affect business strategies.

Because of these hurdles, many developers are turning to alternatives like OTA (over-the-air) updates. While the App Store offers a secure and centralized system, exploring faster, more adaptable options can be a game changer for many teams.

## Direct OTA Updates with Capacitor

Direct over-the-air (OTA) updates let developers bypass app store review delays, making it easier to release new features and fixes quickly. This approach changes how updates are delivered to users' devices.

### What Are Direct OTA Updates?

With direct OTA updates, developers can push changes to JavaScript, HTML, and CSS without needing to submit a new app version to the app stores. Using Capacitor, these updates can be sent straight to users' devices, simplifying the entire [update process](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/manual-update/).

### Why Use Direct OTA Updates?

| **Advantage** | **Explanation** |
| --- | --- |
| **Faster Updates** | Changes reach users immediately, skipping the time-consuming app store reviews. |
| **Cost Savings** | Avoids recurring submission fees for app updates. |
| **Seamless for Users** | Updates happen in the background without requiring user action. |
| **More Control** | Lets developers test features with specific user groups. |

These benefits make OTA updates an attractive option for teams focused on speed and adaptability. Tools like Capgo add extra layers of security with encryption and integrate with CI/CD pipelines for smooth, secure updates.

### Staying Compliant and Managing Risks

When using OTA updates, it’s essential to follow platform-specific guidelines:

-   **Content Changes**: OTA updates are generally fine for UI tweaks, content updates, or small functionality adjustments.
    
-   **Native Code**: Any changes to native code must still go through the app store review process.
    
-   **Platform Policies**: Updates must use secure delivery mechanisms to comply with platform rules.
    

Platforms such as Capgo include features like version control and rollback options, ensuring updates are both safe and compliant. These safeguards help developers avoid risks while taking advantage of the flexibility OTA updates provide.

That said, developers should carefully weigh the speed and convenience of OTA updates against the thoroughness and structure of app store updates to decide what works best for their app.
