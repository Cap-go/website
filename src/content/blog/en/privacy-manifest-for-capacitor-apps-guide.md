**Want to launch your [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) app on the [App Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_\(Apple\)) without delays?** Start by creating a Privacy Manifest. Apple now requires developers to include this document to ensure apps meet strict privacy standards. Here's what you need to know:

-   **What is a Privacy Manifest?**  
    A structured file outlining your app's data collection practices, API usage, and tracking domains.
    
-   **Why it matters:**
    
    -   Complies with App Store rules to avoid rejections or removal.
    -   Builds trust by being transparent about user data handling.
-   **Key components to include:**
    
    -   APIs accessing user data (e.g., location, photos).
    -   Privacy labels for collected data types.
    -   Tracking domains used for analytics or ads.
-   **How to create one:**
    
    -   Use JSON to define data collection details.
    -   Place the `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` file in the correct directory of your project.
    -   Validate it with tools like [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) to avoid errors.
-   **Tools to simplify the process:**  
    Use platforms like [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) for automated privacy manifest validation, real-time updates, and error tracking.
    

**Stay compliant, protect user privacy, and avoid app store delays by following this guide.**

## Privacy Manifest Basics

### Privacy Manifest Definition

A privacy manifest is a structured file that outlines your app's data practices. It details elements like APIs accessing user data, tracking domains, data types collected, and third-party SDK integrations. This document not only helps establish trust but also ensures compliance with App Store guidelines. Let’s break down the key components your manifest should include.

### Main Privacy Manifest Elements

Here are the primary elements to include in your privacy manifest to align with Apple's requirements:

1.  **Required Reason APIs**  
    This section lists the privacy-sensitive APIs your app uses and explains why they are necessary.
    
    Below is a table summarizing common API requirements:
    
    | API Category | Common Usage | Required Documentation |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Location Services | User navigation | Purpose string and usage description |
    | Photo Library | Profile pictures | Access level and intent |
    | Contacts | Address book sync | Data minimization statement |
    
2.  **Privacy Labels**  
    These labels provide transparency by specifying:
    
    -   Types of data being collected
    -   Reasons for data collection
    -   Whether the data is linked to user identity
    -   How the data is used for tracking
3.  **Tracking Domains**  
    This section lists all domains involved in tracking, such as those used for analytics, advertising, or third-party data processing.

According to Capgo, 95% of users comply with updates within 24 hours. With over 23.5 million updates delivered [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/), keeping your privacy documentation current is essential for maintaining user trust.

## Building Privacy Manifests for [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/)

![Capacitor](https://assets.seobotai.com/capgo.app/67ec9a7d7747adc4bca8a776/7e137b9b90adb3934b29b03381f213c1.jpg)

### Setup Requirements

Before you start building the manifest, make sure you have:

-   Xcode 15 or later installed
-   A Capacitor 5.0+ project set up
-   Access to your app's `Info.plist` file
-   A basic understanding of JSON structure
-   Documentation outlining your app's data collection practices

### Creation Steps

Start by creating a `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` file in your iOS project directory. This file must follow specific formatting guidelines:

**Set Up Basic Information**

```json
{
    "NSPrivacyTracking": false,
    "NSPrivacyTrackingDomains": [],
    "NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypes": []
}
```

**Define Data Collection Details**

```json
{
    "NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypes": [
        {
            "NSPrivacyAccessedAPIType": "NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription",
            "NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypeReasons": ["1.1"]
        },
        {
            "NSPrivacyAccessedAPIType": "NSCameraUsageDescription",
            "NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypeReasons": ["2.1"]
        }
    ]
}
```

**Add Tracking Domains**

```json
{
    "NSPrivacyTrackingDomains": [
        "analytics.yourdomain.com",
        "metrics.yourdomain.com"
    ]
}
```

### Avoiding Common Errors

To prevent issues, keep these tips in mind:

-   **Include All Required Fields**: Even if some fields are empty, they must be present.
-   **Use Valid API Types**: Cross-check API identifiers with Apple's official documentation.
-   **Check JSON Formatting**: Run your file through a JSON linter to catch syntax errors.
-   **Provide Complete Reasons**: Make sure every API access includes a corresponding reason code.
-   **Keep Information Up-to-Date**: Update the manifest whenever new features are added.

Also, ensure the manifest file stays under 512KB to avoid build errors. Regularly validate the file during Xcode's build process to catch mistakes early. Once your manifest is ready, integrate it into your Capacitor project by following the file placement guidelines.

## Adding Privacy Manifests to Capacitor

### File Placement Guide

To include a privacy manifest in your Capacitor project, place the `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` file in the following directory structure:

```
your-app/
├── ios/
│   ├── App/
│   │   ├── PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy
│   │   └── Info.plist
│   └── App.xcworkspace
```

For Capacitor plugins, use this structure:

```
your-plugin/
├── ios/
│   ├── Plugin/
│   │   └── PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy
│   └── Plugin.xcodeproj
```

### Build Settings Setup

Once the file is in place, update your Xcode build settings to ensure it integrates properly:

1.  Open your project in Xcode.
2.  Under **TARGETS**, select your app or plugin target.
3.  Go to the **Build Settings** tab.
4.  Set **Privacy Manifest Development Region** to `en`.
5.  Set **Include Privacy Manifest** to `YES`.

If your project uses [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/), include the following snippet in your `Podfile` to enable the privacy manifest:

```ruby
post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings['INCLUDE_PRIVACY_MANIFEST'] = 'YES'
    end
  end
end
```

After making these changes, proceed with implementation checks to verify everything is set up correctly.

### Implementation Check

To ensure the privacy manifest is working as intended, follow these steps:

1.  **Build Verification**
    
    -   Confirm there are no privacy-related warnings during the build.
    -   Ensure the manifest compiles without issues.
    -   Verify the privacy manifest is included in the build products.
2.  **Runtime Validation**
    
    -   In debug mode, test for proper privacy prompts and API access behavior.
3.  **App Store Connect Validation**
    
    -   Upload your build and review the Privacy Report in App Store Connect.
    -   Check that API declarations are complete and tracking domain formats are correct.

If you encounter a "Privacy Manifest validation failed" error, double-check your manifest to ensure it meets the latest App Store requirements. Pay special attention to API types and tracking domain configurations.
