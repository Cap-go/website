## Plugin Selection Guide

### US Market Requirements

When selecting an OTA update plugin for the US market, it's crucial to prioritize compliance and security. Here's a breakdown of what to look for:

| Requirement | Impact | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App Store Rules | Critical | Capgo's instant updates meet Apple and Google guidelines. |
| Security Standards | High | End-to-end encryption ensures user data protection. |
| Update Performance | Medium | API response times averaging 434 ms ensure updates are delivered reliably. |
| CI/CD Integration | High | Automated deployment streamlines the update process. |

After understanding these requirements, focus on picking the right plugin based on your project's size and needs.

### Best Plugins by Project Size

The size of your project plays a significant role in determining the best plugin. Here's how to choose:

-   **Solo Developers**: Opt for affordable solutions with essential features.  
    _Example_: Capgo's SOLO plan supports up to 1,000 monthly active users for $12/month.
    
-   **Small Teams**: Look for scalable options with collaborative tools.  
    _Example_: Capgo's MAKER plan supports 10,000 monthly active users and includes team collaboration features for $33/month.
    
-   **Enterprise**: Prioritize scalability and advanced security.  
    _Example_: [Capgo's PAYG plan](https://capgo.app/docs/webapp/payment/) supports up to 1,000,000 monthly active users, includes 10 TB of bandwidth, and offers self-hosting options.
    

Capgo stands out by offering cost-efficient plans with enterprise-grade features. For instance, their one-time CI/CD setup fee of $2,600 is a practical alternative to more expensive enterprise solutions [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).
