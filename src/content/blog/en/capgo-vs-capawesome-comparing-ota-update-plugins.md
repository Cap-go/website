## Key Features Comparison

Capgo and Capawesome take different approaches when it comes to update delivery, version control, and development tools. A key technical difference is that Capgo uses industry-standard semantic versioning (semver) while Capawesome implements a custom version system, which can impact how developers manage and track their updates.

### How Updates Work

Both Capgo and Capawesome employ [channel-based systems](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/channel-system/), allowing developers to target specific user groups with tailored versions. This is ideal for beta testing or rolling out updates in stages. Capgo differentiates itself with built-in analytics, enabling teams to monitor update success rates and adjust their strategies for better results. These analytics features make Capgo particularly effective for optimizing deployment strategies.

### Version Management

The two platforms handle version control in notably different ways:

| Feature | Capgo | Capawesome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Versioning System | Semantic Versioning (semver) | Custom version system |
| Rollback Capability | One-click rollback to any previous version | [Manual bundle management](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/self-hosted/encrypted-bundles/) |
| Version Targeting | Channel-based distribution system | Channel-based distribution system |
| Update Analytics | Real-time tracking with success metrics | Limited tracking features |
| Multi-version Support | Simultaneous version deployment | Simultaneous version deployment |

Capgo's use of semantic versioning (semver) follows industry standards, making it easier for developers to manage version compatibility and dependencies. Combined with its one-click rollback feature, this provides a robust system for version management and quick recovery from issues without disrupting users.

### Development Tools

Capgo is designed to support modern development workflows with features like:

-   **CI/CD Integration**: Works with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions), [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), and [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) for automated deployments.
-   **CLI Capabilities**: Simplifies deployments with single-command updates.
-   **API Access**: Provides flexibility for custom deployment pipelines.

These tools make Capgo a strong choice for teams looking to streamline complex deployment processes. On the other hand, Capawesome offers a more straightforward toolset tailored to smaller teams with simpler deployment requirements.

## Speed and Stability

When it comes to performance, speed and reliability are crucial factors for ensuring smooth OTA updates. Let’s take a closer look at how Capgo and Capawesome stack up in terms of update speed and error management.

### Update Speed

Capgo stands out with impressive update delivery times. For a 5MB package, it clocks in at just **114ms**. Here's how the two compare:

| Metric | Capgo | Capawesome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Update Delivery Speed** | 114ms (5MB) | Not specified |
| **Storage Capacity** | Up to 20GB | Basic storage |
| **Success Rate** | 82% on first attempt | Not reported |

This combination of fast delivery and ample storage capacity makes Capgo a solid choice for projects requiring high performance and reliability.

### Error Handling

Capgo also excels in error management. It offers a **one-click rollback** feature, which helps reduce downtime in case of update failures. Additionally, its **real-time analytics** provide insights to ensure smooth update performance. On the other hand, Capawesome's error-handling capabilities are not as well-documented, indicating it might be more suitable for simpler projects that don’t demand advanced recovery features.

Capgo’s balance of speed and robust error management makes it a strong contender for handling demanding update scenarios.

## Safety and App Store Rules

When it comes to OTA update plugins, ensuring security and meeting app store standards is non-negotiable.

### Security Features

Capgo takes security seriously by implementing **end-to-end encryption** for update packages and maintaining **SOC II compliance**, safeguarding the entire update process [\[1\]](https://capgo.app). This not only protects updates but also aligns with the compliance requirements of Apple and Google [\[1\]](https://capgo.app). Additionally, Capgo operates with both US and EU entities, providing flexibility for data residency requirements. Capawesome offers EU or global data residency options but does not have a US legal entity. 

To ensure continuous security, Capgo is **publicly audited at each commit** by CodeRabbit and SonarCloud, maintaining an **A score in SonarCloud** for code quality and security. We have also undergone **private auditing as part of our SOC II certification process**. On the other hand, Capawesome relies on **signature-based verification** without the same level of compliance certification or continuous auditing.

| Security Feature | Capgo | Capawesome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Encryption Approach | End-to-end encryption | Signature-based |
| Compliance | SOC II certified | Not SOC II certified |
| Data Residency | US & EU entities | EU or global (no US entity) |
| Security Auditing | Public audits per commit (CodeRabbit, SonarCloud A score) + SOC II audit | No public auditing |

But security isn't just about encryption. Managing teams effectively is another key piece of the puzzle.

### Team Management

Capgo offers advanced tools for team oversight, including **granular permission controls**, support for multiple organizations, and **audit logging**. These features are designed to help larger organizations manage updates across several app portfolios with precision. Meanwhile, Capawesome provides a simpler setup, which may be better suited for smaller or less complex teams.

## Cost Analysis

When selecting the right OTA plugin, cost is just as important as performance and security. Let’s break down the pricing and long-term expenses to help you make an informed decision.

### Price Plans

Capgo offers three main pricing tiers, each tailored to different user needs:

-   **SOLO**: $12/month (billed annually), includes 1,000 monthly active users (MAU), 50 GB bandwidth, and 2 GB storage.
-   **MAKER**: $33/month, supports 10,000 MAU, 500 GB bandwidth, and 5 GB storage.
-   **TEAM**: $83/month, accommodates 100,000 MAU, 2,000 GB bandwidth, and 10 GB storage.

Here’s a quick comparison:

| Feature | Capgo SOLO | Capgo MAKER | Capgo TEAM |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Monthly Price** (Annual Billing) | $12 | $33 | $83 |
| **Monthly Active Users (MAU)** | 1,000 | 10,000 | 100,000 |
| **Bandwidth** | 50 GB | 500 GB | 2,000 GB |
| **Storage** | 2 GB | 5 GB | 10 GB |

Capawesome offers similar tiered pricing:

-   **FREE**: $0/month, includes 100 MAU, 500 MB storage, and 5 GB bandwidth.

Our credit system is designed to support companies of any size with fair pricing at any scale, with [detailed pricing for credits available on our pricing page](https://capgo.app/pricing/).

### Long-term Costs

Beyond monthly fees, it’s essential to consider the broader financial picture, especially for [update management](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/manual-update/).

Capgo differentiates itself with industry-standard semantic versioning, SOC II compliance, continuous security auditing (CodeRabbit and SonarCloud with A score), end-to-end encryption, and presence in both US and EU markets. Capawesome offers competitive features at a lower starting price point with a custom version system.

### Matching the Platform to Your Team

**For Startups and Small Teams:** If your priority is keeping costs low, Capawesome's free tier (100 MAU) or Starter plan at $7.5/month offers an attractive entry point. Capgo's SOLO plan at $12/month provides additional security features and proven reliability. Both cover essential features, making them good fits for teams operating with limited resources.

**For Growing Companies:** With a track record of managing billions of updates across production apps [\[1\]](https://capgo.app), Capgo demonstrates it can handle scaling needs effectively. Its flexible team management tools and reliable performance make it a solid choice for organizations preparing to expand. Just ensure you regularly evaluate your requirements as your team grows.

> "We are currently giving a try to @Capgo since Appcenter stopped live updates support on hybrid apps and @AppFlow is way too expensive." - Simon Flack [\[1\]](https://capgo.app)

For teams that need proven reliability, compliance certifications, and a comprehensive feature set, Capgo's established infrastructure and SOC II compliance deliver clear advantages. However, Capawesome's competitive pricing may appeal to teams looking for similar functionality at a lower cost. Consider your team's size, technical capabilities, security requirements, and budget to make the best decision.
