## 1\. Breaking [App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/) Rules

![App Store](https://assets.seobotai.com/capgo.app/67fb1d712e221594daf42935/ab359297e839832a0f76203cfe630f58.jpg)

One major mistake developers often make with OTA updates is ignoring app store guidelines. Both Apple’s App Store and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/games?hl=en_US&gl=US) have strict rules for app updates, and breaking these rules can result in rejection - or even the app being removed entirely.

### Key App Store Compliance Requirements

-   **Security and Privacy**: Updates must use secure transmission protocols and end-to-end encryption to protect user data and device security. Both Apple and Google prioritize strong privacy measures as part of their regulations.
-   **User Experience Protection**: OTA updates shouldn’t drastically change the core app experience that was originally approved. As industry expert Bessie Cooper puts it, "Avoiding review for bugfix is golden." Focus updates on fixes and minor improvements, not fundamental changes.

### Best Practices for Staying Compliant

-   Use version control to document and track changes.
-   Keep detailed update logs to provide a clear record for app store reviews.
-   Test all updates against the latest app store guidelines before releasing them.

Platforms like [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) can simplify compliance.

As app store rules evolve, staying informed and using solutions built for compliance can save you from costly errors and app removals.

## 2\. Rushing Update Testing

Testing thoroughly is a must. Skipping it can lead to bugs that hurt user experience and damage your app's reputation. A well-planned testing process ensures updates are reliable and compliant with rules.

### The Cost of Inadequate Testing

Skipping proper testing often results in bugs slipping through, leading to poor reviews and frustrated users.

### How to Test Updates Effectively

Breaking testing into clear phases helps catch issues early and ensures smoother rollouts.

#### Channel-Based Testing System

A channel-based system allows you to test updates with specific groups before releasing them to everyone. This method minimizes risk by identifying problems early.

| Testing Phase | Purpose | Target Audience |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Alpha Channel** | Initial testing | Internal team |
| **Beta Channel** | Extended testing | Selected users |
| **Production Channel** | Staged rollout | All users |

This phased approach ensures updates meet the compliance standards discussed earlier.

#### Key Testing Components

-   **Error Tracking**: Use real-time error tracking to catch issues as they happen.
-   **Rollback Options**: Have a system in place to quickly revert to a stable version if needed.
-   **Pull Request (PR) Testing**: Test pull requests using channel selectors before deploying them widely.

### Best Practices for Update Testing

-   **Staged Deployments**: Start with a small group of users and expand as stability is confirmed.
-   **Performance Monitoring**: Track metrics like load times, memory use, and battery impact across devices and operating systems.
-   **Cross-Device Testing**: Test updates on a variety of devices and OS versions to ensure compatibility.

Tools like Capgo help simplify this process with features like real-time error tracking and quick rollbacks, making it easier to meet both technical and compliance standards.
