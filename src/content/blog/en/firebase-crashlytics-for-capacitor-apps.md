## Setup Requirements

Before diving in, make sure you’ve completed the following steps:

### Required Software and Accounts

You'll need to install the following:

-   **Node.js** (v16 or higher) and **Capacitor** (v4 or higher)
-   A **Firebase account** with an active project
-   **Xcode 14+** for iOS development
-   **Android Studio Electric Eel** or a newer version for Android development
-   The latest version of **[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)** (required for iOS)

### Platform Configuration Files

**For iOS:**

-   Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file from the Firebase Console.
-   Update your `Podfile` to include Crashlytics dependencies.
-   Add the necessary privacy keys to your `Info.plist` file.

**For Android:**

-   Obtain the `google-services.json` file from the Firebase Console.
-   Make changes to both the project-level and app-level `build.gradle` files.
-   Update the `AndroidManifest.xml` to include the required permissions.

### [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) Console Setup

![Firebase](https://assets.seobotai.com/capgo.app/6805ba51360079f947b8a1bf/e510e8ab32244fff0b09e93222500c83.jpg)

Set up Firebase and enable Crashlytics through these steps:

1.  **Create a Firebase project** and enable Crashlytics.
    
2.  **Register your apps** in the Firebase Console:
    
    -   Use the **bundle ID** for iOS and the **package name** for Android.
    -   Download the configuration files: `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) and `google-services.json` (Android).
3.  **Integrate Firebase SDKs** into your app by adding these dependencies:
    
    **For Android (app-level `build.gradle`):**
    
    ```gradle
    dependencies {
        implementation platform('com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:32.0.0')
        implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-crashlytics'
        implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics'
    }
    ```
    
    **For iOS (`Podfile`):**
    
    ```ruby
    pod 'Firebase/Crashlytics'
    pod 'Firebase/Analytics'
    ```
    

Once these steps are complete, you’re ready to move on to the Plugin Installation section.

## Installation Steps

### Plugin Installation

First, install the plugin and [sync it with Capacitor](https://capgo.app/plugins/capacitor-updater/):

```bash
npm install @capacitor-firebase/crashlytics && npx cap sync
```

Then, initialize Crashlytics in your app. Add the following code to `app.component.ts` or `main.ts`:

```typescript
import { FirebaseCrashlytics } from '@capacitor-firebase/crashlytics';
await FirebaseCrashlytics.initialize();
```

### Platform Configuration

Set up the required configurations for Android and iOS platforms.

**Android Setup**

1.  Add the Crashlytics Gradle plugin to your app-level `build.gradle` file:
    
    ```gradle
    buildscript { 
        dependencies { 
            classpath 'com.google.firebase:firebase-crashlytics-gradle:2.9.5' 
        } 
    }
    apply plugin: 'com.google.firebase.crashlytics'
    ```
    
2.  Enable crash collection in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
    
    ```xml
    <meta-data
        android:name="firebase_crashlytics_collection_enabled"
        android:value="true" />
    ```
    

**iOS Setup**

1.  Configure Firebase in `AppDelegate.swift`:
    
    ```swift
    import Firebase
    FirebaseApp.configure()
    ```
    

### Testing Your Setup

Confirm that Crashlytics is working by running a test crash and checking the Firebase Console:

-   Trigger a test crash with a custom key:
    
    ```typescript
    await FirebaseCrashlytics.setCustomKey({key: 'test_scenario', value: 'manual_crash'});
    await FirebaseCrashlytics.crash();
    ```
    
-   Optionally, identify a user:
    
    ```typescript
    await FirebaseCrashlytics.setUserId({userId: 'user123'});
    ```
    
-   Log custom events:
    
    ```typescript
    await FirebaseCrashlytics.log({message: 'Test crash triggered'});
    ```
    

Reports, including stack traces, device details, and custom keys, should appear in the Firebase Console within about 5 minutes.

**Important:** Remove crash calls before releasing your app. To disable crash collection during development, use:

```typescript
await FirebaseCrashlytics.setCrashlyticsCollectionEnabled({enabled: false});
```

## Monitoring Guide

Once you've confirmed your setup with a test crash, use the Firebase Console to track actual crashes and errors in your live app.

### Reading Crash Reports

You can find crash reports in the Firebase Console under the Crashlytics section. Here's what you'll see:

-   **Crash-free users**: The percentage of users who haven't experienced crashes.
-   **Issue stability**: How often crashes are occurring.
-   **Impact analysis**: The number of users affected.

Click on any issue to dive deeper into details like stack traces, device information (e.g., OS version, memory), custom keys, logs, and the user's journey leading up to the crash.

**Pro tip**: Enable the "velocity alerts" feature to get notified when crash rates suddenly increase. This can help you address problems before they impact too many users.

### Error Management Tips

-   **Prioritize by Impact**: Focus on crashes that affect the most users or occur in critical parts of your app. Tracking trends can help you identify urgent issues.
    
-   **Use Custom Keys**: Add context to your crash reports with custom keys. For example:
    
    ```typescript
    await FirebaseCrashlytics.setCustomKey({
      key: 'current_view',
      value: 'payment_processing'
    });
    ```
    
-   **Group Similar Issues**: Take advantage of Firebase's automatic issue grouping. You can also tag related crashes with consistent custom keys and use clear, descriptive titles for easier tracking.
    

### Protecting User Privacy

To ensure compliance and safeguard user data, follow these guidelines:

-   **Permissions**:
    
    -   Mention crash reporting in your privacy policy.
    -   Get user consent for data collection in regions with GDPR regulations.
    -   Provide users with an option to opt-out of crash reporting.
-   **Data Collection Controls**:
    
    ```typescript
    await FirebaseCrashlytics.setCrashlyticsCollectionEnabled({enabled: false});
    await FirebaseCrashlytics.setCrashlyticsCollectionEnabled({enabled: true});
    ```
    
-   **Data Retention**:
    
    -   Set up automatic data deletion after 90 days.
    -   Scrub sensitive information from your reports.
    -   Use non-identifiable custom keys to maintain user privacy while debugging.

## [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) Integration
