```bash
npx cap init
```

Once completed, you can configure these components for your specific project.

## Setup Instructions

### Project Setup

To start, either create a **new Capacitor project** or integrate Capacitor into an existing web app:

```bash
npm init @capacitor/app
cd my-cap-app
npm install
```

If you're adding Capacitor to an existing web app, initialize it in your project directory:

```bash
cd your-web-app
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
npx cap init [appName] [appId]
```

Once initialized, you'll need to add the necessary platforms for native development.

### Platform Setup

Add iOS and Android platforms to your project:

```bash
npm install @capacitor/ios @capacitor/android
npx cap add ios
npx cap add android
```

Update your `capacitor.config.ts` file to include the required configurations:

```typescript
import { CapacitorConfig } from '@capacitor/cli';

const config: CapacitorConfig = {
    appId: 'com.example.app',
    appName: 'My Capacitor App',
    webDir: 'dist',
    bundledWebRuntime: false,
    plugins: {
      // Add plugin settings here
    }
};

export default config;
```

### Build Process

1.  **Build your web assets** by running:

```bash
npm run build
```

2.  **Sync your project with native platforms**:

```bash
npx cap sync
```

After syncing, make sure to configure your environment and live update settings.

### Environment Setup

To manage environments, update your `capacitor.config.ts` file:

```typescript
const config: CapacitorConfig = {
    server: {
      url: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
        ? 'http://localhost:3000'
        : 'https://production-url.com',
      cleartext: true
    }
};
```

Enable live updates with **Capgo** for smoother update delivery:

```bash
npx @capgo/cli init
```

-   Set up [update channels](https://capgo.app/docs/webapp/channels/) for controlled rollouts:

```typescript
{
  channels: {
    beta: {
      percentage: 25,
      deviceId: ['test-device-1']
    },
    production: {
      percentage: 100
    }
  }
}
```

**Automated Maintenance**

-   Regularly update your dependencies.
-   Configure rollback settings to handle failed updates:

```typescript
{
  rollback: {
    enabled: true,
    maxVersions: 3,
    timeout: 300000
  }
}
```

-   Use end-to-end encryption to [secure updates](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/hybrid-update/) [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).
