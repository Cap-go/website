## Best Version Control Methods for Mobile CI/CD

Streamline your mobile development process with these tried-and-true version control practices.

### Commit Rules and Standards

Good commit habits are the foundation of effective version control. Here’s how to keep your commits clean and manageable:

-   **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should focus on a single logical change. For example, separate UI updates from backend logic changes. This approach simplifies tracking and makes rolling back easier if issues arise.
    
-   **Descriptive Messages**: Write clear and structured commit messages. A good message includes a concise subject (50 characters or fewer), a detailed explanation of the change, and references to related issues.
    

Here’s a sample template for a commit message:

```
feat(auth): implement biometric login

- Add FaceID/TouchID support for iOS
- Implement fingerprint authentication for Android
- Update security documentation

Resolves: MOB-123
```

These practices make it easier to understand your codebase’s history and ensure smoother collaboration.

### Mobile Branch Management

Choosing the right branching strategy is critical for managing your code effectively. Here’s a comparison of popular approaches:

| Strategy | Best For | Key Benefits | Challenges |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Feature Branching | Fast-paced teams | Isolated development and easier QA | Risk of communication gaps |
| Release Branching | Multiple release tracks | Stable releases with better control | Can complicate release management |
| Trunk-Based | Small, collaborative teams | Faster integration and quick feedback | Requires strong testing practices |

> "Branching strategies are patterns teams use to determine how they'll approach change management inside of a given code/asset base." - Perforce Software [\[2\]](https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/best-branching-strategies-high-velocity-development)

The right strategy depends on your team’s size, workflow, and goals. Whichever you choose, regularly merging isolated branches helps reduce conflicts and keeps your codebase healthy.

### Version Numbering System

Pair your branch management strategy with a clear version numbering system. The widely-used **semantic versioning** format (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) works well for mobile apps:

-   **MAJOR**: For breaking API changes.
-   **MINOR**: For backward-compatible feature updates.
-   **PATCH**: For bug fixes.

Mobile apps often include build numbers for extra clarity:

```
Version: 2.4.1 (241)
```

-   Increment the **major version** for breaking changes.
-   Update the **minor version** when adding features.
-   Adjust the **patch version** for fixes.
-   Always increase build numbers sequentially.

If your iOS and Android apps have platform-specific features or fixes, maintain separate version tracks. This avoids confusion during releases and troubleshooting.

## Version-Based CI/CD Pipeline Setup

### Version-Based Build Triggers

Set up your [CI/CD pipeline](https://capgo.app/blog/setup-ci-and-cd-gitlab/) to automate builds using version tags. For example, the configuration below ensures that builds are triggered only for valid version tags like `v2.1.0`:

```yaml
workflows:
  version: 2
  mobile-build:
    jobs:
      - build:
          filters:
            tags:
              only: /^v\d+\.\d+\.\d+$/
            branches:
              ignore: /.*/
```

You can also use tagged versions to manage environment-specific builds. For instance:

-   **`v1.2.3-dev`**: Triggers builds for development testing.
-   **`v1.2.3-rc`**: Runs staging builds with full test coverage.
-   **`v1.2.3`**: Deploys the final build to production.

### Build Storage and Delivery

Organizing and storing build artifacts by platform and version is crucial for maintaining consistency and traceability. Here's an example of how you might structure your build storage:

```
/builds
  /ios
    /v2.1.0
      - app-release-v2.1.0.ipa
      - build-metadata.json
  /android
    /v2.1.0
      - app-release-v2.1.0.aab
      - build-metadata.json
```

To manage storage efficiently, implement retention policies that balance cost control with the need to preserve critical versions. Once your builds are stored and organized, you can integrate tools like Capgo to streamline update delivery.

### [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) Update Management

![Capgo](https://assets.seobotai.com/capgo.app/6824286159ff6128992275a6/21f0f35e63cf5752e2e56f9c4dd03eab.jpg)

Capgo allows for instant mobile updates, bypassing the delays of app store approvals. Once your builds are stored, you can automate deployment using Capgo's features for rollouts and rollbacks.

1.  **Automated Deployment Flow**  
    Configure your pipeline to automatically push updates to Capgo after each build.
    
2.  **Version Assignment**  
    Begin with a gradual rollout, starting with 5–10% of users. Monitor performance and expand the rollout based on the data collected.
    
3.  **Emergency Rollbacks**  
    In case of issues, Capgo enables quick rollbacks to a stable version. Here's an example configuration for a manual rollback:
    
    ```yaml
    rollback:
      trigger: manual
      steps:
        - name: Revert to stable
          run: capgo revert --version=${LAST_STABLE_VERSION}
          environment:
            CAPGO_API_KEY: ${SECRETS.CAPGO_KEY}
    ```
    

## Security and Recovery in Version Control

### Security Checks and Scans

Protecting sensitive data and maintaining code integrity are non-negotiable in version control. To ensure this, incorporate tools like static analysis, dependency checks, and secret detection into every build process. Here's a practical example of how you might structure these scans:

```yaml
security_scan:
  steps:
    - name: Static Code Analysis
      run: sonarqube-scanner
      fail_on: critical
    - name: Dependency Check
      run: npm audit
      threshold: high
    - name: Secret Detection
      run: gitleaks detect
      options: --verbose
```

Sensitive credentials, such as [API keys](https://capgo.app/docs/webapp/api-keys/) and certificates, should always be stored in secure secrets vaults - never directly in your repository. Additionally, adopting secure key rotation practices is essential to minimize risks:

| Credential Type | Storage Location | Rotation Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API Keys | CI/CD Secrets Vault | Every 90 days |
| Signing Certificates | Hardware Security Module | Annually |
| Build Tokens | Environment Variables | Every 30 days |

If any security scan flags an issue, it's crucial to act quickly. Follow rollback procedures (outlined below) to address the problem without delay.

### Quick Version Rollback Steps

After running thorough security scans, a rapid rollback can be the difference between a minor hiccup and a major issue. For production environments, controlled rollbacks are particularly effective. Tools like Capgo’s live update system make this process secure and immediate.

1.  **Initial Assessment**
    
    Start by monitoring key performance indicators such as crash rates, API errors, and user engagement. Capgo's analytics dashboard can help you identify any anomalies quickly.
    
2.  **Controlled Rollback**
    
    Use phased rollbacks to gradually revert to the last stable version, minimizing disruption. Here's an example configuration for a phased rollback:
    
    ```yaml
    rollback:
      version: ${LAST_STABLE_VERSION}
      phases:
        - percentage: 5
          duration: 15m
        - percentage: 25
          duration: 30m
        - percentage: 100
          duration: 1h
    ```
    
3.  **Verification Process**
    
    During the rollback, conduct A/B testing to confirm that the previous version resolves the issue. Compare metrics for both the control group and the rollback group using the following criteria:
    
    | Metric | Control Group | Rollback Group |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Error Rate | Current | Previous |
    | Performance | Baseline | Compare |
    | User Flow | Monitor | Validate |
    

For urgent security incidents, Capgo's end-to-end encryption ensures that rollback updates are securely delivered, meeting platform compliance requirements. Its instant deployment feature also cuts down the recovery time significantly compared to traditional app store updates.

## Version Usage Tracking

### Version Analytics Setup

Enhance your CI/CD pipeline by incorporating version usage tracking to improve deployment efficiency and user adoption. With dedicated analytics dashboards, you can monitor deployment trends and measure performance shifts. Start by configuring your monitoring tools with key metrics and alert thresholds, like this:

```yaml
analytics_config:
  metrics:
    - build_duration
    - deployment_success_rate
    - user_adoption_rate
  alert_thresholds:
    build_duration_increase: 15%
    error_rate_threshold: 2%
```

Here’s an example of how to track these metrics effectively:

| Metric | Measurement Frequency | Alert Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Build Duration | Every commit | \>15% increase |
| Deployment Success | Daily | <98% success rate |
| User Adoption | Weekly | <80% on latest version |
| Error Rates | Hourly | \>2% per version |

Once you’ve set up tracking, define a lifecycle for older versions to guide users from outdated releases to supported ones.

### Version End-of-Life Planning

A clear deprecation strategy is crucial for a smooth transition between software versions. Establish a timeline to manage the process effectively, such as:

| Phase | Duration | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Announcement | 90 days | Notify users about the EOL date |
| Migration Period | 60 days | Provide detailed upgrade steps |
| Grace Period | 30 days | Send final reminders |
| Deprecation | Immediate | End support for the version |

By monitoring version usage throughout these phases, you can identify obstacles to migration and ensure most users upgrade without issues.

### Capgo Analytics Tools
