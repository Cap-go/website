**Want better [app updates](https://capgo.app/plugins/capacitor-updater/)? Start by understanding your users.** Usage frequency segmentation categorizes users based on how often they interact with your app, helping you deliver updates that actually matter to them. Here's the breakdown:

-   **Power Users (10+ sessions/month):** Focus on advanced features and early access updates.
-   **Casual Users (3–9 sessions/month):** Improve core functionality and usability.
-   **At-Risk Users (inactive for 2+ weeks):** Prioritize re-engagement and stability.

**Why does this matter?** Tailored updates increase retention by up to 26%, boost adoption rates by 25–35%, and even reduce support tickets by 30–45%. Tools like [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) make it easier by offering precise targeting, secure rollouts, and real-time monitoring.

**How to do it:**

1.  Track user behavior (sessions, feature usage, update installs).
2.  Group users by activity level (power, casual, inactive).
3.  Customize updates for each group (beta testing, staged rollouts, re-engagement).

This approach not only improves user satisfaction but also strengthens your app's performance.

## How to Set Up Usage Frequency Segmentation

To effectively implement usage frequency segmentation, you'll need to track user behavior, organize users into groups based on their activity, and customize updates to meet the needs of each group.

### Track Key User Behavior Metrics

Start by monitoring essential engagement metrics to understand how users interact with your product. Here's a breakdown of what to focus on:

| Metric Type | What to Track | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Usage Patterns** | Daily/weekly sessions, session duration | Distinguish active users from dormant ones |
| **Feature Adoption** | Frequency of feature usage, navigation paths | Learn how users engage with specific features |
| **Update Behavior** | Update installation rates, response time | Gauge the success of your updates |

These insights will help you identify trends and group users based on their activity levels.

### Group Users by Activity Level

Once you've gathered the data, categorize users into distinct groups. For example:

-   **Beta Testers**: Separate them from regular users to test new features in controlled environments.
-   **Power Users**: Identify these highly active users and consider giving them early access to new features.
-   **Inactive Users**: Flag these users for targeted re-engagement efforts.
-   **Segmented Update Tracking**: Monitor how updates perform across these groups to refine your strategy.

This segmentation allows for a more tailored approach to improving user experience.

### Plan Updates for Each User Group

With your users grouped, you can design [update strategies](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/hybrid-update) that cater to their specific needs. Here's how to approach each segment:

-   **Power Users**: Create a beta channel where they can test new features and provide feedback before a full release.
-   **Regular Users**: Use staged rollouts to ensure stability. [Partial updates](https://capgo.app/docs/live-updates/update-behavior/) can reduce bandwidth demands and speed up downloads.
-   **Inactive Users**: Focus on improving core features and stability. Offering one-click rollback options can encourage these users to re-engage.

## Using [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) for User Targeting

## Tips for Better User Segmentation

### Set the Right Update Frequency

Choosing the right update frequency depends heavily on how users interact with your product. For instance, daily active users thrive on frequent updates that keep them engaged and offer early access to new features. On the other hand, regular users might appreciate updates on a bi-weekly or monthly basis, while low-activity users should only receive critical updates to avoid overwhelming them.

To determine the best schedule, consider factors like usage patterns, the complexity of new features, user feedback, and any technical limitations. Once you’ve established a plan, validate it through beta testing targeted at specific user groups.

### Test Your Segmentation Strategy

After setting up your update plan, it's essential to test your segmentation strategy to ensure it works as intended. Beta testing is a great way to validate your approach before rolling it out to everyone.

| Testing Phase | Duration | Key Metrics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initial Beta | 1–2 weeks | Update success rate, crash reports |
| Limited Release | 2–4 weeks | User engagement, feature adoption |
| Full Rollout | 1–2 months | Long-term retention, overall satisfaction |

This phased approach allows you to identify and address potential issues early on. Once testing confirms the strategy’s effectiveness, continue refining it based on results.

### Track and Improve Results

Even after testing, the work doesn’t stop. Regularly tracking performance is key to keeping your segmentation strategy sharp. Real-time monitoring can help you spot trends and make adjustments as needed. Tools like Capgo offer analytics to evaluate update performance and a one-click rollback feature to handle any unexpected hiccups.

To get the most out of your segmentation efforts:

-   **Monitor update adoption rates** across different user groups.
-   **Track error rates** to catch and resolve issues quickly.
-   **Analyze user feedback** to understand the specific needs of each segment.
-   **Leverage Capgo's rollback feature** to minimize disruption when problems arise.
