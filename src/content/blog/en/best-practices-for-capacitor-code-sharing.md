## Code Structure Setup

Having a well-organized code structure is key when scaling Capacitor apps. Here's a look at practical ways to organize project files and build reusable components.

### Folder Organization

A clear folder structure helps separate shared code from platform-specific implementations. Here's an example layout:

| Directory | Purpose | Example Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **/shared** | Code used across all platforms | Services, utilities, interfaces |
| **/platforms** | Platform-specific implementations | Native plugins, UI tweaks |
| **/components** | Reusable UI elements | Custom widgets, elements |
| **/assets** | Static resources | Images, fonts, icons |
| **/services** | Business logic | API clients, state management |

### Creating Reusable Modules

A solid folder structure is the first step toward building reusable modules. To make your modules easy to use and maintain, consider these strategies:

-   **Abstract Platform Differences**: Use interface layers to manage platform-specific variations.
-   **Version Control**: Keep track of updates with strict versioning protocols.
-   **Documentation**: Provide clear, concise instructions for using and integrating modules.

### File Management Tips

Good file management practices can make updates and cross-platform development much smoother:

-   **Organize Assets**: Group assets based on platform compatibility to reduce bundle sizes and improve efficiency.
-   **Manage Cache Effectively**: Use robust caching strategies to improve offline performance and load times.
-   **Streamline Updates**: Take advantage of Capacitor's update features. Using a channel system, you can roll out updates to specific user groups before a full release.

## Testing and Debug Methods

Testing shared code in Capacitor apps requires a clear and structured approach to ensure consistent performance. Below, we’ll cover effective tools and methods for both testing and debugging.

### Test Planning

To properly test shared Capacitor code, you need a well-rounded plan that addresses every layer of your app. Here’s a breakdown of how to organize your testing process:
