## Main Cybersecurity Laws and Regulations

### China Cybersecurity Law (CSL)

The China Cybersecurity Law (CSL) lays out fundamental requirements for maintaining network security. These include real-name registration, implementing strong security measures, conducting regular assessments, and promptly reporting incidents. Recent amendments, set to take effect in March 2025, introduce stricter penalties for violations to align with evolving data protection standards [\[1\]](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-cybersecurity-law-amendments-2025/).

### Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL)

The Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) enforces strict guidelines for managing user data, emphasizing transparency and security. Key provisions include:

| **Requirement** | **Details** | **Implementation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **User Consent** | Obtain explicit permission for data collection and usage | Already in effect |
| **Cross-border Transfers** | Conduct security reviews and secure government approval for data exports | Within 60 days of collection |
| **Data Protection** | Apply technical safeguards to secure personal data | Ongoing monitoring |

PIPL also mandates that app developers adopt clear and open data-handling practices while maintaining detailed records of user consent. Violations can lead to operational suspensions and fines of up to ¥50 million (approximately $7.5 million) [\[2\]](https://www.hunton.com/privacy-and-information-security-law/china-regulator-proposes-amendments-to-cybersecurity-law). These rules form the backbone for the technical measures outlined in the Data Security Management Rules.

### Data Security Management Rules

Starting January 1, 2025, the Network Data Security Management Regulation introduces a comprehensive framework for managing data-related risks. The regulation emphasizes:

-   **Risk Assessments**: Evaluate data sensitivity, processing volumes, and potential national security impacts.
-   **Technical Safeguards**: Classify data, implement access controls, and encrypt sensitive information.
-   **Incident Response**: Maintain robust documentation and technical measures to address security incidents.

These updates aim to strengthen enforcement and tackle emerging cybersecurity challenges [\[1\]](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-cybersecurity-law-amendments-2025/).

For app developers working on updates and security patches, utilizing [secure update platforms](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/hybrid-update/) can simplify compliance with these regulations. For instance, **Capgo** (https://capgo.app) offers end-to-end encryption and real-time [update management](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/manual-update/), which is particularly valuable in a market with over 4 million mobile apps and the largest base of mobile Internet users worldwide [\[4\]](https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/en-us/knowledge/publications/93003105/china-issues-new-rules-to-tighten-regulation-of-mobile-apps-market).

## Data Privacy Requirements

### User Identity Verification

Before activating user accounts, implement real-name verification using either mobile phone numbers or government-issued IDs. Ensure the true identities are recorded and encrypted, while allowing users to display public aliases. Additionally, log user activities as required by regulations [\[4\]](https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/en-us/knowledge/publications/93003105/china-issues-new-rules-to-tighten-regulation-of-mobile-apps-market). To streamline this process, consider integrating with authorized local verification services like those provided by [China Mobile](https://www.chinamobileltd.com/) and [China Unicom](https://www.chinaunicom.com/) [\[4\]](https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/en-us/knowledge/publications/93003105/china-issues-new-rules-to-tighten-regulation-of-mobile-apps-market).

It's equally important to ensure all stored data complies with local hosting regulations.

### Data Storage Requirements

All data from Chinese users must be stored on servers located within mainland China, following the Network Data Security Management Regulation, which takes effect on January 1, 2025 [\[1\]](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-cybersecurity-law-amendments-2025/). If data needs to be transferred abroad, it must first undergo a government security review or obtain explicit user consent [\[3\]](https://www.dlapiperdataprotection.com/?t=law&c=CN).

To meet these requirements, collaborate with authorized Chinese cloud providers like [Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/) or [Tencent Cloud](https://www.tencentcloud.com/). This ensures that user data stays within the designated geographic boundaries.

Once storage requirements are met, focus on implementing the necessary security measures outlined below.

### Required Security Standards

The cybersecurity framework for 2025 emphasizes using robust encryption protocols to safeguard user data [\[1\]](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-cybersecurity-law-amendments-2025/)[\[3\]](https://www.dlapiperdataprotection.com/?t=law&c=CN). Key measures include:

| Security Measure | Technical Specification | Purpose |
