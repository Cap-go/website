## Setup Requirements

[Integrating Capgo](https://capgo.app/docs/webapp/) with GitHub Actions involves setting up the necessary tools and configurations.

### Required Tools and Accounts

Make sure you have the following accounts and tools ready:

| Requirement | Purpose | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **GitHub Account** | Version Control & CI/CD | Active account with access to repositories |
| **Capgo Account** | Manage Live Updates | Plans start at $12/month for the SOLO plan |
| **Capacitor Project** | App Development | A functional project ready for integration |
| **Node.js** | Runtime Environment | Latest LTS version is recommended |

Once these are in place, you can proceed to add Capgo to your project for automated live updates.

### Adding [Capgo](https://capgo.app/) to Your Project

![Capgo](https://mars-images.imgix.net/seobot/screenshots/capgo.app-26aea05b7e2e737b790a9becb40f7bc5-2025-03-16.jpg?auto=compress)

To integrate Capgo, install it in your Capacitor project using its CLI tool. According to Martin Donadieu, founder of Capgo:

> "Run npx @capgo/cli init that it!" [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

This command will set up the plugin and its required dependencies.

### GitHub Repository Setup

Prepare your GitHub repository to meet the requirements for CI/CD integration with Capgo. As mentioned in their documentation:

> "We configure your CI/CD pipeline directly in your preferred platform, whether it's GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or others. We don't host CI/CD or charge you to maintain it." [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

Capgo offers this setup for a one-time fee of $2,600 and ~$300/month, which is more affordable compared to AppFlow's $6,000 annual fee [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/).

Hereâ€™s how to set up your repository:

-   **Repository Structure**: Organize your repository with separate directories for source code, assets, and configuration files to keep everything clean and manageable.
-   **Environment Configuration**: Create distinct environments for development, staging, and production, ensuring proper access controls and security measures are in place.
-   **Access Management**: Set repository permissions carefully to allow [Capgo integration](https://capgo.app/consulting/) while maintaining security.

These steps will ensure your project is ready for the GitHub Actions workflow, which will be outlined in the next section.

## GitHub Actions Workflow Setup

Automate your [Capgo deployments](https://capgo.app/docs/cli/commands/) using GitHub Actions to streamline your CI/CD process.

### Creating the Workflow File

Start by creating a YAML file in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository. Here's an example:

```yaml
name: Capgo Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18.x'
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Build App
        run: npm run build
      - name: Deploy to Capgo
        run: npx @capgo/cli deploy
        env:
          CAPGO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CAPGO_TOKEN }}
```

This configuration ensures secure and automated deployments. Once you've set up the file, choose the right triggers for your workflow.

### Workflow Trigger Options

GitHub Actions allows you to customize when workflows run. Here are some trigger options:

| **Trigger Type** | **Use Case** | **Configuration** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Push Events | Deploy on code changes | Activates when code is pushed to specific branches |
| Manual Dispatch | On-demand updates | Allows you to manually start the workflow |
| Schedule | Timed releases | Runs deployments at set intervals |
| Pull Request | Testing updates | Tests changes before merging into main branches |

### Managing Secret Keys

To ensure secure deployments, you need to manage your secret keys properly. GitHub Actions offers an encrypted secrets management system for this purpose.

**Steps to Set Up Secure Authentication:**

1.  **Access Repository Settings**  
    Go to your repository's settings and find the "Secrets and variables" section under the "Security" tab.
    
2.  **Add [Capgo Credentials](https://capgo.app/trust/)**  
    Save your Capgo authentication token as a repository secret. Name it `CAPGO_TOKEN`.
    
3.  **Reference Secrets in Workflows**  
    Use your stored secrets in the workflow by referencing them like this: `${{ secrets.CAPGO_TOKEN }}`.
    

## Capgo Commands in Workflows

Once your GitHub Actions environment is set up, you can automate deployments by integrating Capgo CLI commands.

### Installing Capgo CLI

Add the following step to your workflow to install the Capgo CLI:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Install Capgo CLI
    run: npm install -g @capgo/cli
  - name: Initialize Capgo
    run: npx @capgo/cli init
```

### Authenticating the CLI

Securely authenticate the CLI using the `CAPGO_TOKEN`:

```yaml
- name: Authenticate Capgo CLI
  run: npx @capgo/cli login
  env:
    CAPGO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CAPGO_TOKEN }}
```

### Deployment Commands

Here are the key commands to handle building, versioning, and deploying your updates:

| Command | Purpose | Usage Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `build` | Generates a [production-ready bundle](https://capgo.app/docs/webapp/bundles/) | `npx @capgo/cli build` |
| `deploy` | Pushes updates to Capgo | `npx @capgo/cli deploy` |
| `version` | Sets the version for the update | `npx @capgo/cli version 1.2.0` |

To automate the entire deployment process, use the commands together like this:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Build and Deploy
    run: |
      npx @capgo/cli build
      npx @capgo/cli version ${{ github.ref_name }}
      npx @capgo/cli deploy
    env:
      CAPGO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CAPGO_TOKEN }}
```

This setup ensures that your updates are automatically built, versioned, and deployed whenever the workflow runs. GitHub's secret management system keeps your credentials safe throughout the process.

## Testing and Fixes

### Running Test Workflows

You can test your GitHub Actions workflow by using a dedicated [Capgo testing channel](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/channel-system/). This allows you to validate updates before they go live.

```yaml
- name: Test Build Deployment
  run: |
    npx @capgo/cli build
    npx @capgo/cli deploy --channel beta
  env:
    CAPGO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CAPGO_TOKEN }}
```

Capgo's channel system helps you create separate deployment paths for different stages:

| Channel | Purpose | Target Audience |
| --- | --- | --- |
| beta | Pre-release testing | Internal team |
| staging | QA validation | Test users |
| production | Live deployment | All users |

### Error Solutions

Here are some common integration issues and how to address them:

1\. **Authentication Failures**

Check the CAPGO\_TOKEN in GitHub Secrets. If it's expired, regenerate it to ensure smooth authentication.

2\. **Build Errors**

Ensure your build configuration matches the requirements of your deployment environment.

> "We rolled out Capgo OTA updates in production for our user base of +5000. We're seeing very smooth operation almost all our users are upto date within minutes of the OTA being deployed to @Capgo." [\[1\]](https://capgo.app/)

3\. **Version Conflicts**

Stick to semantic versioning and increment versions properly to prevent conflicts during deployments.

### Maintenance Tips

-   Use [Capgo analytics](https://capgo.app/dp/) to monitor update success rates.
-   Enable automatic rollbacks for updates that might cause issues.
-   Test pull requests (PRs) using channel selectors for better control.
-   Keep your workflow updated with the latest Capgo CLI commands.

For high-priority deployments, take advantage of Capgo's error tracking to spot potential issues early. If something goes wrong, the rollback feature allows you to revert to a stable version quickly, minimizing disruption. These practices will help keep your deployments running smoothly as you move closer to production.
