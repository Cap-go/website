# The Birth of Capgo: My Journey Revolutionizing Capacitor App Updates

As a developer, I've always believed that innovation stems from necessity. This is the story of how I created Capgo, a groundbreaking live update system for Capacitor apps, born from my own frustration with existing solutions. Let me take you through my journey of how Capgo came to be, step by step.

## The Spark of an Idea

It all began in October 2021 when I voiced my concerns about the limitations of existing update solutions for Capacitor apps on a GitHub thread.

The main pain points I identified were:

1. High costs for small-scale developers
2. Lack of over-the-air (OTA) updates in affordable plans
3. Unnecessary features for solo developers

## The Community Resonates

My concerns struck a chord with other developers. Many echoed the sentiment that existing solutions were overpriced for indie developers and small teams.

One developer summarized the community's feelings:

"It would be brilliant if the Community plan included 500 live updates. Or better yet, if there was a Live Update only package for $50/month that included 5,000 Live Updates."

## The Birth of a Solution

Motivated by the community's response, I decided to take matters into my own hands. On October 24, 2021, I announced my plan to build a module that would allow developers to download updates from a given URL.

The initial goals were simple:
- Download data from a URL
- Unzip the data
- Replace the current code with the new one

## Rapid Development and Community Support

Over the next few weeks, I made significant progress. By November 22, 2021, I had a working version for iOS and was improving the developer experience.

The community's excitement was palpable, with developers offering help and suggestions. This collaborative spirit pushed me to develop the project rapidly.

## Expanding Capabilities

As development progressed, I added more features:
- Android support
- Persistence between app kills
- The ability to revert to the original app version

## The Launch of Capgo

By March 2022, the project had evolved into a full-fledged product: Capgo. I announced the release of an auto-update mode, allowing developers to connect to their own backend or use Capgo's backend service.

The community's response was overwhelmingly positive, with developers praising this much-needed solution.

## The Future of Capgo

On June 11, 2022, I announced that Capgo would start charging for usage in 15 days, marking its transition from a community project to a sustainable business. However, I maintained the project's open-source roots by allowing free use of the plugin in manual mode or with a custom server.

## Conclusion

My journey with Capgo is a testament to the power of community-driven innovation. What started as my frustration with existing solutions grew into a robust, affordable, and flexible live update system for Capacitor apps. Capgo's evolution from idea to product showcases the collaborative spirit of the developer community and the potential for grassroots solutions to revolutionize app development.

As Capgo continues to evolve, it stands as a prime example of how identifying a gap in the market and actively working to fill it can lead to the creation of valuable tools that benefit the entire developer ecosystem.
