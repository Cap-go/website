## Step 3: Automatic Updates with CapGo

Automatic updates with CapGo provide a seamless way to keep your Quasar app up-to-date without the need for App Store or Play Store reviews. Let's set it up:

1. **Create a CapGo Account**: If you haven't already, create an account on [capgo.app](https://capgo.app) to get your API key.


2. **Initialize CapGo**: In your terminal, run the following command to initialize CapGo with your API key:

    ```shell
    npx @capgo/cli@latest init YOUR_API_KEY
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the API key you obtained from CapGo.


3. **Notify App Ready**: In your Quasar application code (usually found in `src/main.js`), add the following import statement to notify CapGo when your app is ready:

    ```javascript
    import { CapacitorUpdater } from '@capgo/capacitor-updater'
    CapacitorUpdater.notifyAppReady()
    ```

    This informs CapGo that the current update bundle has loaded successfully.


4. **Download and Set Updates**: Now, you can use CapGo to download and set updates in your application. Here's an example of how to do it:

    ```javascript
    const version = await CapacitorUpdater.download({
      url: 'https://example.com/update.zip', // Replace with your update URL
    })
    await CapacitorUpdater.set(version); // Sets the new version and reloads the app
    ```

    Failed updates will automatically roll back to the last successful version, ensuring a seamless user experience.
