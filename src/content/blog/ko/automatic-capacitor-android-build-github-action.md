## Continuous Delivery for Android using Fastlane and GitHub Actions

## Prerequisites

Before continuing with the tutorial‚Ä¶

-   Make sure you use GitHub
-   Your app is already deployed on Google Play store
-   Desire to read üòÜ‚Ä¶

## Important about the price

![Price GitHub Action](/price_github_actions.webp)

[https://github.com/features/actions](https://github.com/features/actions/)

The service is ‚Äò_free‚Äô_ up to the limit, depending on the chosen machine.  
We are going to use a **_Linux_** machine, you can see in the screenshot its price and limits (prices as of the creation of the tutorial, they could undergo changes in the future)

üî¥ **_Once warned of requirements and prices, if you want, we continue..._**

> **_üì£_ In the post we assume that we have the app created in Google Play, we do have the signing key of the Google ecosystem**

## Let‚Äôs go to the mess üßëüèΩüíª

**Steps to follow in the post**

1.  _Copy Fastline files_
2.  _Storing your secrets in GitHub encrypted secrets_
3.  _Creating & storing your Google Play service account key_
4.  _Storing your Android signing key_
5.  _Set up your GitHub Actions workflow .yml file_

## 1\. Copy Fastline files

Fastlane is a Ruby library created to automate common mobile development tasks. Using Fastlane, you can configure custom ‚Äúlanes‚Äù which bundle a series of ‚Äúactions‚Äù that perform tasks that you‚Äôd normally perform using Android studio. You can do a lot with Fastlane, but for the purposes of this tutorial, we‚Äôll be using only a handful of core actions.


Create a Fastlane folder at the root of your project and copy the following files:
Fastlane
```ruby
default_platform(:android)

KEYSTORE_KEY_ALIAS = ENV["KEYSTORE_KEY_ALIAS"]
KEYSTORE_KEY_PASSWORD = ENV["KEYSTORE_KEY_PASSWORD"]
KEYSTORE_STORE_PASSWORD = ENV["KEYSTORE_STORE_PASSWORD"]

platform :android do
    desc "Deploy a beta version to the Google Play"
    private_lane :verify_changelog_exists do |version_code: |
      changelog_path = "android/metadata/en-US/changelogs/#{version_code}.txt"
      UI.user_error!("Missing changelog file at #{changelog_path}") unless File.exist?(changelog_path)
      UI.message("Changelog exists for version code #{version_code}")
    end

    private_lane :verify_upload_to_staging do |version_name: |
      UI.message "Skipping staging verification step"
    end
    lane :beta do
				keystore_path = "#{Dir.tmpdir}/build_keystore.keystore"
				File.write(keystore_path, Base64.decode64(ENV['ANDROID_KEYSTORE_FILE']))
				json_key_data = Base64.decode64(ENV['PLAY_CONFIG_JSON'])
				previous_build_number = google_play_track_version_codes(
					package_name: ENV['DEVELOPER_PACKAGE_NAME'],
					track: "internal",
					json_key_data: json_key_data,
				)[0]

				current_build_number = previous_build_number + 1
				sh("export NEW_BUILD_NUMBER=#{current_build_number}")
        gradle(
          task: "clean bundleRelease",
          project_dir: 'android/',
          print_command: false,
          properties: {
            "android.injected.signing.store.file" => "#{keystore_path}",
            "android.injected.signing.store.password" => "#{KEYSTORE_STORE_PASSWORD}",
            "android.injected.signing.key.alias" => "#{KEYSTORE_KEY_ALIAS}",
            "android.injected.signing.key.password" => "#{KEYSTORE_KEY_PASSWORD}",
						'versionCode' => current_build_number
          })
        upload_to_play_store(
					package_name: ENV['DEVELOPER_PACKAGE_NAME'],
					json_key_data: json_key_data,
          track: 'internal',
          release_status: 'completed',
          skip_upload_metadata: true,
          skip_upload_changelogs: true,
          skip_upload_images: true,
          skip_upload_screenshots: true,
        )
    end
    lane :build do
      gradle(
        task: "clean bundleRelease",
        project_dir: 'android/',
        print_command: false,
        properties: {
          "android.injected.signing.store.file" => "#{keystore_path}",
          "android.injected.signing.store.password" => "#{KEYSTORE_STORE_PASSWORD}",
          "android.injected.signing.key.alias" => "#{KEYSTORE_KEY_ALIAS}",
          "android.injected.signing.key.password" => "#{KEYSTORE_KEY_PASSWORD}",
        })
    end
    lane :prod_release do
      build_gradle = File.read("../android/app/build.gradle")

      verify_changelog_exists(version_code: build_gradle.match(/versionCode (\d+)/)[1])
      verify_upload_to_staging(version_name: build_gradle.match(/versionName '([\d\.]+)'/)[1])

      supply(
        track_promote_to: 'beta',
        skip_upload_apk: true,
        skip_upload_aab: true,
        skip_upload_metadata: false,
        skip_upload_changelogs: false,
        skip_upload_images: false,
        skip_upload_screenshots: false
      )
    end
end
```

## Storing your secrets in GitHub encrypted secrets

To authenticate with the Google Play Developer API, we‚Äôll need a service account key. The service account key file is considered sensitive, which means we‚Äôll need to store it securely, but in a place where it can be accessed by our GitHub Actions workflows and our Fastfile when needed. Enter GitHub‚Äôs encrypted secrets: we‚Äôll be storing all our sensitive keys in repository secrets, holding them securely while also making them automatically accessible to the GitHub Actions workflows in the repository.

### Creating & storing your Google Play service account key

If you need to create a new service account key, [follow the steps outlined here](https://docs.runway.team/integrations/app-stores/google-play-console/#service-account-api-key-setup). One you have your service account key JSON file, let‚Äôs add it to your GitHub repository‚Äôs encrypted secrets.

To add a new secret to GitHub‚Äôs encrypted secrets, first navigate to the Android repo to which you‚Äôll be adding the GitHub Actions workflow. On the far right, click ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù.

![Settings in GitHub repo](/github_project_settings.webp)

Then, click ‚ÄúSecrets‚Äù, 

![Secrets in GitHub repo, from Settings](/github_project_settings_secrets.webp)

then ‚ÄúActions‚Äù from the list in the left menu.

![Actions under Secrets in GitHub repo](/github_project_settings_secrets_actions.webp)

These are the encrypted secret environment variables for the repository. Any workflows set up on the repository will have access to these repository secrets.

From here, click ‚ÄúNew repository secret‚Äù to add a new secret:

![New repository secret action in GitHub](/github_project_settings_secrets_actions_new.webp)

When you click ‚ÄúNew repository secret‚Äù, you‚Äôll see a form that will prompt you to enter a name for your new secret, and its value.

![Adding name and value for new secret in GitHub](/github_project_settings_secrets_actions_new_add.webp)

GitHub secrets only accept string values, so for certain credentials (any .jks or .json files for example), you‚Äôll first need to convert the file to a base64-encoded string before adding it to GitHub secrets. You can do this from the command line:

```
base64 in_file_path | pbcopy
```

This copies the resulting string to your clipboard, so you can paste it directly into a new repository secret on GitHub.

For example:

```
base64 service_account_key.json | pbcopy
```

Let's create a new repository secret as follows:

-   PLAY_CONFIG_JSON: the base64-encoded service account key JSON

_Kindly note that you should store a backup copy of your secrets securely in another location (somewhere that is not GitHub encrypted secrets), as you won‚Äôt be able to export or access the credentials again from GitHub after you‚Äôve added them._

With our service account key added to GitHub‚Äôs repository secrets, we can now authenticate with the Google Play Developer API from within any GitHub Actions workflows added to the repository.

### Storing your Android signing key

To properly [sign Android release builds](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing/) in CI, the workflow will need access to either an Android upload key or an app signing key. Apps created after August 2021 will use Google‚Äôs new [Play App Signing](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing/#app-signing-google-play/) system by default, in which a user-managed upload key is used to sign AABs before upload, but the app signing key is managed by Google. If your team is making use of Google‚Äôs Play App Signing, then all you‚Äôll need for the CI pipeline is your app‚Äôs _upload key,_ since signing is deferred until after the AAB has been uploaded to the Play Console. If you still need to create an upload key and keystore, follow the [instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing/#generate-key/) found in the Android developer documentation.

If your team hasn‚Äôt yet migrated to Google‚Äôs Play App Signing system, then you‚Äôll instead need to make your app _signing_ key available to the CI workflow to properly sign your app before upload.

Add the following as repository secrets:


-   ANDROID_KEYSTORE_FILE:¬† the base64-encoded `.jks` or `.keystore` file used to sign your Android builds. This will either be the keystore file associated with your upload key (if using Play App Signing), or your app signing key.
-   KEYSTORE_KEY_PASSWORD: the password associated with the keystore file
-   KEYSTORE_KEY_ALIAS: the key store alias
-   KEYSTORE_STORE_PASSWORD: the private key password
-   DEVELOPER_PACKAGE_NAME: your android app ID like com.example.app
With these secrets added to GitHub‚Äôs repository secrets, we‚Äôre ready to set up our GitHub Actions workflow to run our builds.

![Multiple secrets added successfully in GitHub](/github_project_settings_multi_secrets_added.webp)

## Set up your GitHub Actions workflow .yml file

Now, let‚Äôs set up our Android GitHub Actions workflow .yml file ‚Äì it‚Äôll define the steps we‚Äôll run as part of our workflow. Within these steps, we‚Äôll call our Fastlane lanes.

First, let‚Äôs create the necessary folders. From your project‚Äôs root directory, call:

```
mkdir .github && cd .github && mkdir workflows && cd workflows && touch build-upload-android.yml
```

Then, paste the following code into your newly created `build-upload-android.yml` file:

```yaml
name: Build source code on android

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'

jobs:
  build_android:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Use Node.js 20
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: npm
      - name: Install dependencies
        id: install_code
        run: npm ci

        with:

            ~/.gradle/caches
            ~/.gradle/wrapper
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-gradle-${{ hashFiles('**/*.gradle*', '**/gradle-wrapper.properties') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-gradle-
      - name: Build
        id: build_code
        run: npm run build
      - name: Sync
        id: sync_code
        run: npx cap sync
      - name: Setup java
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
            distribution: 'zulu'
            java-version: '17'
      - uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: '3.0'
          bundler-cache: true
      - uses: maierj/fastlane-action@v3.1.0
        env:
          PLAY_CONFIG_JSON: ${{ secrets.PLAY_CONFIG_JSON }}
          ANDROID_KEYSTORE_FILE: ${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEYSTORE_FILE }}
          DEVELOPER_PACKAGE_NAME: ${{ secrets.DEVELOPER_PACKAGE_NAME }}
          KEYSTORE_KEY_ALIAS: ${{ secrets.KEYSTORE_KEY_ALIAS }}
          KEYSTORE_KEY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.KEYSTORE_KEY_PASSWORD }}
          KEYSTORE_STORE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.KEYSTORE_STORE_PASSWORD }}
        with:
          lane: android beta
      - name: Upload release bundle
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: android-release
          path: ./android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
          retention-days: 10
```

This workflow should be triggered after each GitHub _tag_, if you need to automatize tag please, refer to [Automatic build and release with GitHub actions](/blog/automatic-build-and-release-with-github-actions/)

Then this workflow will pull your Node.js deps, install them and build your JavaScript app.

Your App doesn't need to use Ionic, only Capacitor base is mandatory., it can have old Cordova module, but Capacitor JS plugin should be preferred.

> Each time you send a new commit, a release will be built in Google Play console, beta channel.

I will improve this blog with your feedbacks, if you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know by email martin@capgo.app

## **Build Processing**

In GitHub Actions, **you are billed based on the minutes** you have used for running your CI/CD workflow. From experience, it takes about 3‚Äì5 minutes before a build can be processed in Google Play Store.

For private projects, the estimated cost per build can go up to **$0.008/min x 5 mins = $0.4**, or more, depending on the configuration or dependencies of your project.

For Open-source projects, this shouldn‚Äôt be a problem at all. See [pricing](https://github.com/pricing/).
