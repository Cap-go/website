WebP is a modern image format that can provide significant savings in file size compared to JPEG, while maintaining similar or better visual quality. By converting your JPEG images to WebP in your mobile app, you can potentially reduce the size of your app, which can lead to faster download times and improved performance for your users.

WebP is well-supported by most of the major mobile platforms and devices, including Android and iOS. Unlike JPEG, WebP provides a superior image quality at a lower file size, which results in faster download times, fewer data usage, and a better user experience. This is especially important for mobile apps that are used on cellular networks, where data usage and download times are major concerns.

When it comes to converting your images to WebP, there are a few options available. One popular option is to use a command-line tool like `cwebp`, which can be easily integrated into your app's build process. Another option is to convert your images to WebP in [Android Studio](https://sites.google.com/a/android.com/tools/tech-docs/webp/), which can be used to manually convert your images. You can also use a plugin for your content management system (CMS) or an automated service like Kraken.io.

Once you've converted your images to WebP, it's significant to test the performance of your app to see if there's any improvement. You can use tools like [the Firebase Performance Monitoring plugin](https://github.com/capawesome-team/capacitor-firebase/tree/main/packages/performance/) or other performance testing tools to measure the app's performance. You should also consider testing the app on different devices and networks to get a more accurate picture of how the conversion to WebP will affect the app's performance.

In addition to improving the performance of your app, converting your images to WebP can also have a positive impact on your app's overall user experience. With faster download times and fewer data usage, users are more likely to have a positive experience with your app, which can lead to increased engagement and retention.

Overall, converting your images to WebP can be an effective way to optimize your mobile app's assets and improve the performance of your app. It's a simple and straightforward process that can have a big impact on the overall user experience of your app. By taking the time to convert your images to WebP, you'll be able to provide a better experience for your users and potentially increase engagement and retention.
