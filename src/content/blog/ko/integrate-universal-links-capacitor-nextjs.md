Universal links on iOS and App Links on Android allow users to be taken directly into your app from a link, bypassing the browser. This is particularly useful for improving user experience and maintaining the context from a web page to an app. In this guide, we'll walk through the process of setting up these deep links for a Next.js app using Capacitor.

Setting up deep links doesn't require a lot of code, but it does involve some configuration. By the end of this guide, you'll be able to click a link like `https://www.capgo.app/details/22` and have your app open to the correct page if it's installed.

## Next.js Deep Link Setup

First, we'll create a new Next.js app and a details page for testing:

```sh
npx create-next-app@latest capgoLinks
cd capgoLinks
mkdir pages/details
touch pages/details/[id].js
npm run build
npx cap add ios
npx cap add android
```

Ensure your **bundle ID** is correctly set in the **capacitor.config.json** file, as it's crucial for the setup:

```json
{
  "appId": "com.capgo.deeplinks",
  "appName": "capgoLinks",
  "webDir": "out",
  "bundledWebRuntime": false
}
```

For routing, Next.js uses file-based routing, so by creating a file at `pages/details/[id].js`, we've already set up our wildcard route.

In `pages/details/[id].js`, we can retrieve the ID from the URL using Next.js's built-in router:

```jsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

function DetailsPage() {
  const router = useRouter()
  const { id } = router.query

  return (
    <div>
      <p>My ID: {id}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default DetailsPage
```

Now, let's handle the `appUrlOpen` event with Capacitor. This event is triggered when the app is opened via a custom URL scheme. Add a listener in the `pages/_app.js` file:

```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import { App } from '@capacitor/app'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    App.addListener('appUrlOpen', (event) => {
      const slug = event.url.split('.app').pop()
      if (slug)
        window.location.href = slug

    })
  }, [])

  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}

export default MyApp
```

This code listens for the `appUrlOpen` event and navigates to the appropriate route within your Next.js app.

## iOS Configuration

For iOS, you'll need an app ID with Associated Domains enabled. Create an **apple-app-site-association** file with the following content, replacing `YOURTEAMID` and `com.your.bundleid` with your actual team ID and bundle ID:

```json
{
  "applinks": {
    "apps": [],
    "details": [
      {
        "appID": "YOURTEAMID.com.your.bundleid",
        "paths": ["*"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Upload this file to the `.well-known` directory on your domain, making it accessible at `https://www.capgo.app/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`.

In Xcode, add the domain to your app's entitlements using the format `applinks:capgo.app`.

## Android Configuration

For Android App Links, follow these steps:

1. Generate a keystore file if you don't have one.
2. Obtain the SHA256 fingerprint from the keystore.
3. Create an **assetlinks.json** file with your package name and SHA256 fingerprint.
4. Upload this file to the `.well-known` directory on your domain.

In your `AndroidManifest.xml`, add an `intent-filter` to the `activity` element that handles deep links:

```xml
<activity ...>
  <intent-filter android:autoVerify="true">
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <data android:scheme="https" android:host="capgo.app" />
  </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

After uploading the `assetlinks.json` file, you can verify it using Google's Digital Asset Links tool. If everything is set up correctly, you'll see a green checkmark.

To build and sign your app, use the following commands:

```sh
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
cd ..
jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore my-release-key.keystore android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk alias_name
zipalign -v 4 android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk capgo.apk
adb install capgo.apk
```

This will install the signed app on your connected Android device.

## Capacitor Configure for Native Project Settings

To automate native project settings, consider using the [Capacitor configure package](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor-configure/). Install it in your project:

```sh
npm install @capacitor/configure
```

Create a `capacitor.config.yaml` file at the root of your project:

```yaml
vars:
  BUNDLE_ID: com.capgo.deeplinks
  PACKAGE_NAME: com.capgo.deeplinks
platforms:
  ios:
    targets:
      App:
        bundleId: $BUNDLE_ID
    entitlements:
      - com.apple.developer.associated-domains: ['applinks:capgo.app']
  android:
    packageName: $PACKAGE_NAME
```

Run the configure tool with this config:

```sh
npx cap-config run capacitor.config.yaml
```

This will apply the settings specified in the YAML file to your native projects.

## Conclusion

Setting up deep links with Capacitor for a Next.js app involves configuring your domain and project settings for both iOS and Android. While the process requires attention to detail, it's streamlined compared to older methods and doesn't require additional plugins. Ensure your domain verification files are correctly served and check them with the respective platform tools. Once set up, your app will seamlessly open from web links, providing a smooth transition for your users from web to app.
