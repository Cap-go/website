# Introduction

Hey, I am Michael ([WcaleNieWolny](https://github.com/WcaleNieWolny)) üëã,

After a month of hard (and a bit painful üôÉ) work, I am pleased to announce the first release of the Capacitor Social Login. This plugin is designed to assist in handling both Google and Apple Login on iOS and Android. Furthermore, together with Martin, we have been working on some unique features that include:

 - The introduction of Login with Apple on Android 
 - The adoption of the new Google Credentials API
 - The addition of detailed documentation

# Login with Apple on Android

First, let‚Äôs discuss the major innovation of ‚ÄòLogin with Apple‚Äô on Android. This was non-trivial, as Apple‚Äôs SDK doesn‚Äôt provide this functionality. I used [this article](https://johncodeos.com/how-to-add-sign-in-with-apple-button-to-your-android-app-using-kotlin/) as my reference point, but I changed it a little in order to make it more secure. The flow I ended up looks like this:

Unfortunately, it requires a backend and some modifications to your‚Äôs app code, but it‚Äôs the best I could do.

# Refreshed Google Login on Android

Next, I attempted to implement Google Login on Android. As it turns out, [CodetrixStudio‚Äôs CapacitorGoogleAuth](https://github.com/CodetrixStudio/CapacitorGoogleAuth) uses a [soon-to-be deprecated GMS library](https://developer.android.com/identity/sign-in/legacy-gsi-migration#authorization). As a result of this GMS library being considered legacy, I decided to use the [CredentialManager](https://developer.android.com/identity/sign-in/credential-manager-siwg). This helped simply the login flow and it removed the annoying [error 10](https://github.com/CodetrixStudio/CapacitorGoogleAuth/issues/332) üéâ

# Documentation

Lastly, I wrote some amazing ‚ú® documentation. I spent a lot of time making sure that the docs were accurate and extensive.
The docs include a detailed guide on setting both Apple and Google. I also provided an [example backend](https://github.com/WcaleNieWolny/capgo-social-login-backend-demo) for Login with Apple üçé

Feel free to check out the [Apple](https://github.com/Cap-go/capacitor-social-login/blob/main/docs/setup_apple.md) and [Google](https://github.com/Cap-go/capacitor-social-login/blob/main/docs/setup_google.md) guides!

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the Capacitor Social Login plugin introduces a lot of new and exciting features with more to come in the future üöÄ
