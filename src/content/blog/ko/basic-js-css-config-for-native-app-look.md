# Basic JS and CSS Configurations for a Native App Look

When building a web app, it's essential to make it look and feel like a native app to provide a seamless user experience. In this article, we'll cover the basic JavaScript and CSS configurations needed to achieve a native app look, including disabling hover effects.

## Disable Hover Effects

On touch devices, hover effects can be problematic as they don't have a true hover state like desktop devices. To disable hover effects on touch devices, you can use the following CSS code:

```css
@media (hover: none) {
  .element:hover {
    /* Reset the hover styles */
    background-color: initial;
    color: initial;
    /* Add any other style resets needed */
  }
}
```

Replace `.element` with the appropriate selector for the elements you want to disable hover effects on.

## Disable Link Preview

To disable link preview on touch devices, you can use the following JavaScript code:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('touchstart', function(event) {
  if (event.target.tagName === 'A') {
    event.preventDefault();
  }
});
```

## Disable Selection

To disable text selection, add the following CSS code to your stylesheet:

```css
body {
  -webkit-touch-callout: none;
  -webkit-user-select: none;
  -khtml-user-select: none;
  -moz-user-select: none;
  -ms-user-select: none;
  user-select: none;
}
```

## Disable Zoom

To disable zooming, add the following meta tag to the head of your HTML file:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no">
```

## Add Safe CSS Zone

To ensure your content is displayed within the safe area of the device, add the following CSS code to your stylesheet:

```css
body {
  padding: env(safe-area-inset-top) env(safe-area-inset-right) env(safe-area-inset-bottom) env(safe-area-inset-left);
}
```

## Additional Tips

- Use responsive design techniques to ensure your app looks great on all devices.
- Optimize your app's performance by minimizing the use of heavy JavaScript libraries and frameworks.
- Test your app on various devices and browsers to ensure compatibility and a consistent user experience.

By following these basic JavaScript and CSS configurations, you can create a web app that looks and feels like a native app, providing a seamless and enjoyable user experience.
