    </p>
    <h1>Subscriptions</h1>
    <h2>Subscription period</h2>
    <p>
      The Service or some parts of the Service are available only with a paid Subscription. You will be
      billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (such as daily, weekly, monthly or annually),
      depending on the type of Subscription plan you select when purchasing the Subscription.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of each period, Your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same
      conditions unless You cancel it or the Company cancels it.
    </p>
    <h2>Subscription cancellations</h2>
    <p>
      You may cancel Your Subscription renewal either through Your Account settings page or by
      contacting the Company. You will not receive a refund for the fees You already paid for Your
      current Subscription period and You will be able to access the Service until the end of Your
      current Subscription period.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Subscription has been made through an In-app Purchase, You can cancel the renewal of Your
      Subscription with the Application Store.
    </p>
    <h2>Billing</h2>
    <p>
      You shall provide the Company with accurate and complete billing information including full name,
      address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, the Company will issue an electronic
      invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full
      payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Subscription has been made through an In-app Purchase, all billing is handled by the
      Application Store and is governed by the Application Store's own terms and conditions.
    </p>
    <h2>Fee Changes</h2>
    <p>
      The Company, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees. Any
      Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Subscription period.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Company will provide You with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to
      give You an opportunity to terminate Your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes
      Your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
    </p>
    <h2>Refunds</h2>
    <p>Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>
    <p>
      Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by the Company on a case-by-case basis
      and granted at the sole discretion of the Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Subscription has been made through an In-app purchase, the Application Store's refund
      policy will apply. If You wish to request a refund, You may do so by contacting the Application
      Store directly.
    </p>
    <h2>Free Trial</h2>
    <p>
      The Company may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a Free Trial for a limited
      period of time.
    </p>
    <p>You may be required to enter Your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>
    <p>
      If You do enter Your billing information when signing up for a Free Trial, You will not be charged
      by the Company until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless
      You cancelled Your Subscription, You will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription
      fees for the type of Subscription You have selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any time and without notice, the Company reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and
      conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.
    </p>
    <h1>In-app Purchases</h1>
    <p>
      The Application may include In-app Purchases that allow you to buy products, services or
      Subscriptions.

      out in the Application Store's own terms and conditions or in your Device's Help settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In-app Purchases can only be consumed within the Application. If you make a In-app Purchase, that
      In-app Purchase cannot be cancelled after you have initiated its download. In-app Purchases cannot
      be redeemed for cash or other consideration or otherwise transferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any In-app Purchase is not successfully downloaded or does not work once it has been
      successfully downloaded, we will, after becoming aware of the fault or being notified to the fault
      by You, investigate the reason for the fault. We will act reasonably in deciding whether to
      provide You with a replacement In-app Purchase or issue You with a patch to repair the fault. In
      no event will We charge You to replace or repair the In-app Purchase. In the unlikely event that
      we are unable to replace or repair the relevant In-app Purchase or are unable to do so within a
      reasonable period of time and without significant inconvenience to You, We will authorize the
      Application Store to refund You an amount up to the cost of the relevant In-app Purchase.
      Alternatively, if You wish to request a refund, You may do so by contacting the Application Store
      directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      You acknowledge and agree that all billing and transaction processes are handled by the
      Application Store from where you downloaded the Application and are governed by that Application
      Store's own terms and conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have any payment related issues with In-app Purchases, then you need to contact the
      Application Store directly.

    <p>
      Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of
      its suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing

    </p>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers

      essential purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for
      incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply.
      In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.
    </p>
    <h1>&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</h1>
    <p>
      The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults
      and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law,
      the Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective
      licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied,
      statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of

    </p>
    <p>
      Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on
      applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations
      may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section
      shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.
    </p>
