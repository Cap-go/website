Microsoft announced that App Center will soon [discontinue support for apps running on Apache Cordova](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/appcenter/announcing-apache-cordova-retirement/). App Center is a cloud product that helps teams build, test, and distribute apps. Among App Center’s more popular services is CodePush, which allows developers to deploy mobile app updates directly to their users’ devices.

## From Microsoft App Center to Ionic Appflow

For businesses and teams using App Center, I'm happy to say that [Capgo](https://capgo.app) platform is a great alternative to App Center that provides full support for Capacitor apps. Capacitor is a new way to build native mobile apps with Ionic. Most of Cordova plugin are supported in Capacitor. It's time to migrate to Cordova successor: Capacitor.

Capgo helps to streamline app delivery for hundreds of businesses and teams.

Capgo includes live update functionality similar to CodePush without platform dependencies and immediate app publishing.

Development teams can focus completely on the unique features of their app and outsource the complicated app delivery process to Capgo. Plus, unlike App Center, My solution is 100% focused on hybrid architectures like Capacitor.

Capacitor customers can take advantage of Capgo's complete list of features and easily migrate from Microsoft App Center to Capgo in just a few steps. I created a [migration guide](https://capgo.app/blog/appcenter-migration) to help you walk through the process of migrating from App Center to Capgo.
