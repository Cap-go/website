Ionic AppFlow is the best complete set of tool for your app, sadly they price is not made for all.

The only other alternative was Microsoft App Center, but they shut down support for apps running on Cordova.

If you are a solo developer, or a small team of developers, you will find that Ionic AppFlow is not the best Price for you.

Like you, I was complaining about it, Ionic understands the complaint, but there aren't open to change the pricing, tiny teams are outside they focus.

Back in December 2021, I decided to try to fix my biggest pain in my Capacitor development workflow.

After one month of trying, I found a solution to download from one URL a zip and replace the source of the app.

That where I started to work on Capgo as AppFlow alternative.

The goal is to provide a simple and easy to use solution to push code updates to Capacitor apps.

No Native build, not big toolbox like Ionic, just live updates, for the market they don't address, Us.

You are welcome to join the community to build together, I use it for my own projects too, and even I expect this become my main project in the future.

# Features comparisons

If you are a big team with big budget I still think AppFlow is the best solution for you.

Otherwise :)
