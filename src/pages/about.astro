            <p class="mb-3">
              I started Capgo alone in December 2022, driven by a simple mission: make OTA updates accessible to every developer. 
              The early days were intense - coding through nights, handling support calls, fixing bugs, and building features all by myself. 
              Every customer interaction, every line of code, every decision was mine to make. It was exhausting but fulfilling, 
              as each new customer validated the need for an affordable alternative to expensive enterprise solutions.

            <p class="italic text-gray-400">

            <p class="mb-3">
              As Capgo grew through early 2023, performance became crucial. Users needed faster updates, smaller bundle sizes, and better native integration. 
              In August 2023, Michael joined as our Software Engineer specializing in native development. With his deep expertise in iOS and Android 
              internals, he transformed how Capgo handles updates at the system level. Michael didn't just optimize our code - he reimagined 
              our entire native architecture. His work reduced update sizes by 40% and improved installation speed by 3x, making Capgo 
              competitive with solutions 10x our price. You can see Michael in both our team photos - he's been integral to our success.

            <p class="mb-3">
              By early 2025, we crossed a major milestone: $10,000 monthly recurring revenue. But with growth came new challenges. 
              Our web dashboard needed a complete overhaul, users demanded better analytics, and the product needed someone who could 
              think like both an engineer and a product manager. Jordan joined as our Full-Stack Engineer, bringing years of product 
              management experience. He didn't just code - he reimagined our entire user experience. Under his guidance, he redesigned 
              the web application from scratch, making it intuitive for both indie developers and enterprise teams. User satisfaction 
              scores jumped 35% within months of his improvements.

            <p class="mb-3">
              Early 2025 brought unexpected but exciting challenges: major applications with over 5 million users started adopting Capgo. 
              These weren't just regular customers - they were enterprise clients needing dedicated support, complex deployment strategies, 
              and someone who could manage relationships at scale. Valeria (we call her Lera) joined as our Project Manager and Customer Success Manager. 
              She brought order to what was becoming chaotic growth. She created onboarding playbooks, established support processes, 
              and most importantly, ensured our biggest clients felt heard and supported. With Valeria managing these relationships, 
              I could finally step back from day-to-day operations and focus on strategic growth.
            </p>
            <p class="italic text-gray-400">
              "Valeria is the reason our enterprise clients trust us with their critical infrastructure. She makes the impossible seem easy." - Martin

            <p class="mb-3">
              My role has completely transformed. I'm no longer the solo developer coding until dawn. As CEO, I focus on vision, 
              strategy, and taking important customer calls when needed. Michael ensures our technology stays cutting-edge and performant. 
              Jordan keeps our product delightful and powerful, always thinking about the user journey. Valeria (Lera) makes sure every customer, 
              from indie hackers to Fortune 500 companies, succeeds with Capgo.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              We're not just a team; we're a family united by a simple belief: every developer deserves access to instant, affordable updates. 
              From our base in beautiful Madeira, Portugal - where we work hard and play harder, scaling mountains and 
              climbing walls together - we serve thousands of applications and millions of end users worldwide. 
              What started as my solo project has become a collaborative effort where each team member brings unique expertise that 
              makes Capgo better than I could have ever imagined alone.
            </p>
            <p class="font-bold text-white text-lg">
              The journey from 1 to 4 has been transformative, but this is just the beginning. Together, we're building the future of app deployment. üöÄ

            This magical moment was captured during our team offsite week at Pico do Arieiro, Madeira's third-highest peak. 
            Here, Valeria (Lera), Michael, and Martin watch the sunset above the clouds after a day of strategic planning. 
            This same week included climbing adventures with Jordan, combining work sessions with Madeira's incredible nature. 
            These offsites aren't just about work - they're about building trust, sharing adventures, and creating the bonds 
            that make our remote-first team feel like family. From mountain peaks to climbing walls, we believe the best 
            ideas come when we step outside the office and into nature.
