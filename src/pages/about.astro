          <div>
            <h3 class="mb-3 text-xl font-bold text-white">December 2022: The Solo Beginning</h3>
            <p class="mb-3">
              I started Capgo alone in December 2022, driven by a simple mission: make OTA updates accessible to every developer. The early days were intense - coding through
              nights, handling support calls, fixing bugs, and building features all by myself. Every customer interaction, every line of code, every decision was mine to make. It
              was exhausting but fulfilling, as each new customer validated the need for an affordable alternative to expensive enterprise solutions.
            </p>
            <p class="italic text-gray-400">
              "I remember taking customer calls at 3 AM from different time zones. I was tired, but their excitement about Capgo kept me going." - Martin

            <p class="mb-3">
              As Capgo grew through early 2023, performance became crucial. Users needed faster updates, smaller bundle sizes, and better native integration. In August 2023,
              Michael joined as our Software Engineer specializing in native development. With his deep expertise in iOS and Android internals, he transformed how Capgo handles
              updates at the system level. Michael didn't just optimize our code - he reimagined our entire native architecture. His work reduced update sizes by 40% and improved
              installation speed by 3x, making Capgo competitive with solutions 10x our price. You can see Michael in both our team photos - he's been integral to our success.
            </p>
            <p class="italic text-gray-400">"Michael brought the technical excellence we needed. He could see optimizations I didn't even know were possible." - Martin</p>

            <p class="mb-3">
              By early 2025, we crossed a major milestone: $10,000 monthly recurring revenue. But with growth came new challenges. Our web dashboard needed a complete overhaul,
              users demanded better analytics, and the product needed someone who could think like both an engineer and a product manager. Jordan joined as our Full-Stack Engineer,
              bringing years of product management experience. He didn't just code - he reimagined our entire user experience. Under his guidance, he redesigned the web application
              from scratch, making it intuitive for both indie developers and enterprise teams. User satisfaction scores jumped 35% within months of his improvements.
            </p>
            <p class="italic text-gray-400">"Jordan sees the product through users' eyes. Every feature he builds solves a real problem our customers face." - Martin</p>

            <p class="mb-3">
              Early 2025 brought unexpected but exciting challenges: major applications with over 5 million users started adopting Capgo. These weren't just regular customers -
              they were enterprise clients needing dedicated support, complex deployment strategies, and someone who could manage relationships at scale. Valeria (we call her Lera)
              joined as our Project Manager and Customer Success Manager. She brought order to what was becoming chaotic growth. She created onboarding playbooks, established
              support processes, and most importantly, ensured our biggest clients felt heard and supported. With Valeria managing these relationships, I could finally step back
              from day-to-day operations and focus on strategic growth.
            </p>
            <p class="italic text-gray-400">
              "Valeria is the reason our enterprise clients trust us with their critical infrastructure. She makes the impossible seem easy." - Martin

              needed. Michael ensures our technology stays cutting-edge and performant. Jordan keeps our product delightful and powerful, always thinking about the user journey.

          <p class="text-gray-300">
            This magical moment was captured during our team offsite week at Pico do Arieiro, Madeira's third-highest peak. Here, Valeria (Lera), Michael, and Martin watch the
            sunset above the clouds after a day of strategic planning. This same week included climbing adventures with Jordan, combining work sessions with Madeira's incredible
            nature. These offsites aren't just about work - they're about building trust, sharing adventures, and creating the bonds that make our remote-first team feel like
            family. From mountain peaks to climbing walls, we believe the best ideas come when we step outside the office and into nature.
