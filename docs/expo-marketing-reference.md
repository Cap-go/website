## Meta-Level Messaging Principles

1. **Lead with Business Outcome, Not Feature**
   - Expo: "Ship fixes in minutes" not "We have fast uploads"
   - Apply: Frame every feature as a business result

2. **Use Contrast/Comparison**
   - Expo: "minutes, not weeks"
   - Already used: TestFlight comparison table

3. **Quantify When Possible**
   - Expo: 81%, 78%, 99.9%
   - Add more Capgo-specific metrics

4. **Address Pain Points Directly**
   - Expo: "can't afford two codebases"
   - Apply: "can't afford App Store delays during critical bug"

5. **Social Proof Pattern**
   - Expo uses testimonials and adoption stats
   - Consider adding customer logos/quotes
