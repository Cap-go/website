The only other alternative was Microsoft App Center, but they shut down support for apps running on Cordova.

If you are a solo developer, or a small team of developers, you will find that Ionic AppFlow is not the best Price for you.

Like you, I was complaining about it, Ionic understands the complaint, but there aren't open to change the pricing, tiny teams are outside they focus.

Back in December 2021, I decided to try to fix my biggest pain in my Capacitor JS development workflow.

After one month of trying, I found a solution to download from one URL a zip and replace the source of the app.

That where I started to work on Capgo as AppFlow alternative.

The goal is to provide a simple and easy to use solution to push code updates to Capacitor JavaScript apps.

No Native build, not big toolbox like Ionic, just live updates, for the market they don't address, Us.

I contacted them to share with them what I was doing, and we found a business friendship agreement.

I build for the maker, they build for the big business :)

You are welcome to join the community to build together, I use it for my projects too, and even I expect this to become my main project in the future.

## Features comparisons

If you are a big team with big budget I recommend you to use AppFlow they build the tool with dedicated CSM, not me.

Capgo is more self-service.
