## Prerequisites

Before continuing with the tutorialâ€¦

-   Make sure you use GitHub
-   Use Capacitor
-   Your app is already deployed on Apple Store
-   Desire to read ðŸ˜†â€¦

Using Ionic is optional, for Cordova it could work, but I didn't try.
## Important about the price

![Price Xcode Cloud](/xcode_cloud_price.webp)

[https://developer.apple.com/xcode-cloud/](https://developer.apple.com/xcode-cloud/)

The service is â€˜_freeâ€™_ up to the limit.  
You can see in the screenshot price and limits (prices as of the creation of the tutorial, they could undergo changes in the future)

ðŸ”´ **_Once warned of requirements and prices, if you like, we continue..._**

> **_ðŸ“£_ In the post, we assume that we have the app created in Apple Store**

## Intro

To make Xcode build your Capacitor app, you need to set up a few things.

## Package Preparation

Be sure to have your build command in your `package.json` script.
Then add the `sync:ios` command like below.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "YOUR BUILD COMMAND",
    "sync:ios": "cap sync ios"
  }
}
```
This step will make the post script work simply

## Post clone script
This script will be run by Xcode cloud after the clone step

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -x

export HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP=TRUE
brew install cocoapods
# have to add node yourself link to this issue https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73462672/xcode-cloud-suddenly-failing-to-link-node-and-install-dependencies
NODE_VER=16
VERSION=$(curl -s https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v$NODE_VER.x/ | sed -nE 's|.*>node-(.*)\.pkg</a>.*|\1|p')
if [[ "$(arch)" == "arm64" ]]
then
  ARCH="arm64"
else
  ARCH="x64"
fi

curl "https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v$NODE_VER.x/node-$VERSION-darwin-$ARCH.tar.gz" -o $HOME/Downloads/node.tar.gz
tar -xf "$HOME/Downloads/node.tar.gz"
NODE_PATH="$PWD/node-$VERSION-darwin-$ARCH/bin"
PATH+=":$NODE_PATH"
export PATH
node -v
npm -v

brew install pnpm # optional, you can also install yarn if you use it

# Install dependencies
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
# or `npm ci` or `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`
npm run mobile 
# or npm run build
npm run sync:ios
```

Save this file in the root of your project and name it `ios/App/ci_scripts/ci_post_clone.sh`


## Create a Xcode workflow

Open Xcode (yes, to remove Xcode you need Xcode)

And go to this tab :
![Xcode step 1](/xcode_step_1.webp)

Click on create workflow, select your app, click next like below.

![Xcode step 2](/xcode_step_2.webp)

Click on Edit workflow on the left
![Xcode step 2](/xcode_step_3.webp)

Go to environments tab and chose like below Mac 12.4 and check the proper option
![Xcode step 3](/xcode_step_3.webp)

Choose your start condition.
If you use the same build as us, I suggest to use Tag instead of branch, to avoid double build.

Set your env variable
![Xcode step 4](/xcode_step_4.webp)

Connect your GitHub account
![Xcode step 5](/xcode_step_5.webp)

![Xcode step 6](/xcode_step_6.webp)


Then enable and the workflow and commit your first change, you should see your build running in Xcode.

## **Build Processing**

In Xcode Cloud, **you are billed based on the minutes** you have used for running your CI/CD workflow. From experience, it takes about 10â€“15 minutes before a build can be processed in Apple Store.

For private projects, the estimated cost per build can go up to **$0.008/min x 5 mins = $0.4**, or more, depending on the configuration or dependencies of your project.

For Open-source projects, this shouldnâ€™t be a problem at all. See [pricing](https://github.com/pricing).
