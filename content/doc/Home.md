# Choose between Auto and Manual

In auto mode, part of logic is handled by the Native code, updates are decided server side, this is more secure and allow fine grain update as AB test or Partial deploy.
 
In manual mode, all the logic is handled by the JS, that some good and some bad in both scenario.

# Auto

<details>
  <summary>Good âœ…</summary>

  - No logic to handle, all is done for you
  - Auto-revert is handle for you
  - Statistics of updates available
  - Possibility to revert user
  - Channels to share version to your team
  - Define advanced strategies like AB test or partial deploy

# Open source

The plugin and the back-end are open source and under the LGPL-3.0 License for the plugin and AGPL-3.0 License for the back-end.

> ðŸ’¡ LGPL-3.0 mean if someone modify the code of the project, itâ€™s mandatory to publish it, in open-source with same licensing.
If you use the code without modification, that doesnâ€™t concern you. 
See issue below for more details :
https://github.com/Cap-go/capacitor-updater/issues/7

# know incompatibility 

- when you develop if you use ionic live reload feature from the cli, it will override the plugin so you will never see your update. 
- same issue with quasar live reload

# Last words

If you use this work for free, I couldn't suggest you more to support my work [here](https://github.com/sponsors/riderx).

I made a big bet to open source all the precious code I built here.

I could have kept it for myself and put a high ticket price.

I want to focus on Capgo tooling, and make it an open and transparent business.

I do think it would make our world a better place by opening instead of fighting and hiding.

But to make it possible, it is necessary for all of us to do our part, including you ðŸ¥¹.

If Capgo cloud offer can't suit you, then put your own price and back a bootstrapped Maker 
[HERE](https://github.com/sponsors/riderx) on your own terms.
